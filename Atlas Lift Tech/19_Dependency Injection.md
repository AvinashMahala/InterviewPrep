### Dependency Injection Interview Questions and Answers

---

#### Basic Concepts of Dependency Injection

**1. What is dependency injection?**
**Answer:** Dependency injection is a design pattern used to implement Inversion of Control (IoC) by passing dependencies (services or components) into an object, rather than allowing the object to create its own dependencies. This is achieved by injecting dependencies through constructors, properties, or methods.

---

**2. Why is dependency injection important?**
**Answer:** Dependency injection is important because it promotes loose coupling, enhances code testability, and improves maintainability. By injecting dependencies, classes do not need to create their own dependencies, making the code easier to change and test.

---

**3. What are the types of dependency injection?**
**Answer:** There are three main types of dependency injection:
1. **Constructor Injection:** Dependencies are provided through a class constructor.
2. **Property Injection (Setter Injection):** Dependencies are provided through public properties.
3. **Method Injection:** Dependencies are provided through methods or parameters.

---

**4. How does dependency injection relate to Inversion of Control (IoC)?**
**Answer:** Dependency injection is a specific implementation of the Inversion of Control (IoC) principle. IoC refers to the inversion of the flow of control in a system, where control is transferred from the main program to a framework. Dependency injection inverts the control of creating and managing dependencies, transferring this responsibility from the dependent class to an external entity.

---

**5. What is an IoC container?**
**Answer:** An IoC container is a framework or library that manages the creation, configuration, and injection of dependencies. It maintains a registry of mappings between interfaces and their implementations and resolves dependencies automatically. Examples of IoC containers include Autofac, Unity, and the built-in container in ASP.Net Core.

#### Constructor Injection

**6. What is constructor injection, and how does it work?**
**Answer:** Constructor injection is a form of dependency injection where dependencies are provided through a class constructor. The dependencies are passed as parameters to the constructor, ensuring that the class has all its dependencies available at the time of instantiation.

**Example:**
```csharp
public interface ILogger
{
    void Log(string message);
}

public class FileLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message)
    {
        // Log to file
    }
}

public class OrderService
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;

    public OrderService(ILogger logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public void ProcessOrder(string order)
    {
        _logger.Log("Processing order: " + order);
    }
}
```

**7. What are the advantages of constructor injection?**
**Answer:** Advantages of constructor injection include:
- Ensures all dependencies are provided at the time of object creation.
- Promotes immutability by making dependencies read-only.
- Makes the object easier to test by allowing dependencies to be mocked or stubbed.

---

**8. What are the disadvantages of constructor injection?**
**Answer:** Disadvantages of constructor injection include:
- Can lead to large constructors if a class has many dependencies.
- May complicate object creation if some dependencies are optional or have default values.

---

**9. How can you handle optional dependencies in constructor injection?**
**Answer:** Optional dependencies in constructor injection can be handled by using default values or providing overloaded constructors. Alternatively, using a factory or builder pattern can help manage optional dependencies.

**Example:**
```csharp
public class OrderService
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;
    private readonly INotificationService _notificationService;

    public OrderService(ILogger logger, INotificationService notificationService = null)
    {
        _logger = logger;
        _notificationService = notificationService;
    }

    public void ProcessOrder(string order)
    {
        _logger.Log("Processing order: " + order);
        _notificationService?.Notify("Order processed: " + order);
    }
}
```

---

**10. How do you handle circular dependencies in constructor injection?**
**Answer:** Circular dependencies occur when two or more classes depend on each other directly or indirectly. To handle circular dependencies, consider:
- Refactoring the design to remove circular dependencies.
- Using property or method injection for one of the dependencies.
- Using a lazy loading technique or a proxy to delay the creation of the dependency.

---

#### Property Injection

**11. What is property injection, and how does it work?**
**Answer:** Property injection (also known as setter injection) is a form of dependency injection where dependencies are provided through public properties. The IoC container sets the properties after the object is instantiated.

**Example:**
```csharp
public interface ILogger
{
    void Log(string message);
}

public class FileLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message)
    {
        // Log to file
    }
}

public class OrderService
{
    public ILogger Logger { get; set; }

    public void ProcessOrder(string order)
    {
        Logger?.Log("Processing order: " + order);
    }
}
```

---

**12. What are the advantages of property injection?**
**Answer:** Advantages of property injection include:
- Allows setting dependencies after object creation.
- Useful for optional dependencies.
- Simplifies object creation when dependencies are not available at construction time.

---

**13. What are the disadvantages of property injection?**
**Answer:** Disadvantages of property injection include:
- Dependencies are not guaranteed to be available at the time of object creation, leading to potential null reference issues.
- Makes the object's API more complex by exposing setters.
- Can make the object's state less predictable and harder to test.

---

**14. When should you prefer property injection over constructor injection?**
**Answer:** Property injection is preferred over constructor injection when:
- Dependencies are optional or have reasonable default values.
- Dependencies are not available at the time of object creation.
- The object needs to be reconfigured or dependencies need to be set after instantiation.

---

#### Method Injection

**15. What is method injection, and how does it work?**
**Answer:** Method injection is a form of dependency injection where dependencies are provided through method parameters. The method requires the dependencies to be passed as arguments each time it is called.

**Example:**
```csharp
public interface ILogger
{
    void Log(string message);
}

public class FileLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message)
    {
        // Log to file
    }
}

public class OrderService
{
    public void ProcessOrder(string order, ILogger logger)
    {
        logger.Log("Processing order: " + order);
    }
}
```

---

**16. What are the advantages of method injection?**
**Answer:** Advantages of method injection include:
- Allows providing dependencies on a per-method call basis.
- Useful for temporary or infrequently used dependencies.
- Keeps the object stateless with respect to the dependency.

---

**17. What are the disadvantages of method injection?**
**Answer:** Disadvantages of method injection include:
- Dependencies need to be provided explicitly on each method call.
- Can lead to method signature bloat if multiple dependencies are required.
- Reduces encapsulation by exposing internal details of the class.

---

#### Advanced Dependency Injection

**18. What is a dependency injection container, and how does it work?**
**Answer:** A dependency injection container (or IoC container) is a framework that manages the creation, configuration, and lifecycle of dependencies. It registers mappings between interfaces and their implementations and resolves dependencies automatically.

**Example with ASP.Net Core built-in container:**
```csharp
public interface ILogger
{
    void Log(string message);
}

public class FileLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message)
    {
        // Log to file
    }
}

public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddTransient<ILogger, FileLogger>();
        services.AddTransient<OrderService>();
    }
}

public class OrderService
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;

    public OrderService(ILogger logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public void ProcessOrder(string order)
    {
        _logger.Log("Processing order: " + order);
    }
}
```

**19. What are some popular dependency injection containers for .NET?**
**Answer:** Some popular dependency injection containers for .NET include:
- Autofac
- Unity
- Ninject
- StructureMap
- Castle Windsor
- Simple Injector
- The built-in container in ASP.Net Core

---

**20. How do you register and resolve dependencies using an IoC container?**
**Answer:** Dependencies are registered with the IoC container in the configuration phase, typically in a startup or initialization method. Dependencies are resolved by the container either automatically via constructor injection or manually via a resolve method.

**Example with ASP.Net Core built-in container:**
```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Register services
        services.AddTransient<ILogger, FileLogger>();
        services.AddTransient<OrderService>();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        // Configure middleware
    }
}

// Resolving dependencies
public class SomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly OrderService _orderService;

    public SomeController(OrderService orderService)
    {
        _orderService = orderService;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        _orderService.ProcessOrder("Order1");
        return View();
    }
}
```
