### Sample Interview Questions and Responses:

1. **Tell us about your experience with C# and ASP.Net Core.**
   - *Response:* "In my previous role at Wipro, I led a project to enhance a vehicle tracking system middleware using C# and ASP.Net Core. This project required end-to-end ownership, from user interviews to project delivery. We achieved a 91% decrease in downtime and significantly improved system stability."

2. **Can you describe a project where you designed and implemented REST APIs?**
   - *Response:* "During my time at General Electric, I refactored a data-intensive API service using Python and optimized SQL queries, which resulted in a 94% reduction in latency. Additionally, I have experience implementing REST APIs in my MicroMarket project, where I developed backend services using Django and Flask."

3. **How have you utilized Azure DevOps in your previous projects?**
   - *Response:* "In my role at General Electric, I integrated automated testing workflows in Jenkins' pipeline using Cucumber and Selenium. This integration led to a 97% improvement in productivity tooling. I also have experience setting up CI/CD pipelines and managing deployments using Azure DevOps."

4. **How do you ensure compliance with regulatory standards such as HIPAA?**
   - *Response:* "Although I have not specifically worked on HIPAA compliance, I understand the importance of regulatory standards. In my projects, I ensure that all data handling and processing follow industry best practices for security and privacy. I am keen to learn and adapt to specific regulatory requirements such as HIPAA."

5. **Can you give an example of how you handled a challenging requirement discussion?**
   - *Response:* "At Wipro, I worked on a project that required significant changes to the existing system based on new client requirements. I facilitated discussions between the client, product managers, and the development team to ensure everyone was on the same page. By maintaining clear and open communication, we were able to deliver the project on time and meet all the client's needs."

### Preparation Steps:
1. **Review Technical Concepts:**
