Sample Answer: "Routing in ASP.Net Core is configured in the Startup.cs file using the Configure method. You can define routes using attribute routing directly in controller actions or convention-based routing in the Configure method. Routes map incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controller actions."

**5. What is the difference between MVC and Razor Pages in ASP.Net Core?**

Sample Answer: "MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a design pattern that separates an application into three main components: Model, View, and Controller. Razor Pages is a newer feature in ASP.Net Core that simplifies the development of page-focused scenarios by encapsulating the controller and model into a single file (Page Model) for each view. Razor Pages is typically more straightforward for scenarios where each page corresponds to a single action."

### **Entity Framework Interview Questions**

**1. What is Entity Framework, and what are its benefits?**

Sample Answer: "Entity Framework (EF) is an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for .NET. It allows developers to work with databases using .NET objects, eliminating the need for most of the data-access code they usually need to write. Benefits include improved productivity, maintainability, and a strongly-typed query language (LINQ) for querying data."

**2. What is Code First, Database First, and Model First in Entity Framework?**

Sample Answer: "Code First allows developers to define the data model using C# classes and generate the database from these classes. Database First involves creating the database first and generating the data model from the existing database schema. Model First involves creating an Entity Data Model (EDM) using a designer, from which both the database and C# classes are generated."

**3. How do you handle database migrations in Entity Framework?**

Sample Answer: "Database migrations in Entity Framework are handled using the Migration feature. It allows developers to incrementally update the database schema by writing code to describe the changes. Commands like `Add-Migration` and `Update-Database` in the Package Manager Console or CLI are used to create and apply migrations, respectively."

**4. Explain the difference between eager loading, lazy loading, and explicit loading in Entity Framework.**

Sample Answer: "Eager loading retrieves related entities as part of the initial query using the `Include` method. Lazy loading defers the loading of related entities until they are accessed, which is achieved by virtual navigation properties. Explicit loading is when related entities are explicitly loaded using methods like `Load` after the initial query."

**5. How do you optimize queries in Entity Framework?**

Sample Answer: "Optimizing queries in Entity Framework involves several strategies: using eager loading to reduce the number of database calls, projecting only necessary fields with LINQ's `Select` method, using compiled queries for frequently executed queries, and ensuring proper indexing in the database."

### **Web API Interview Questions**

**1. What is a Web API, and how does it differ from a WCF service?**

Sample Answer: "A Web API is an HTTP-based service used to expose data and functionality over the web. It is lightweight, ideal for building RESTful services, and can be consumed by various clients. WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) is a more complex framework for building services that support multiple protocols (HTTP, TCP, etc.), but it requires more configuration and is typically used for SOAP-based services."

**2. How do you secure a Web API?**

Sample Answer: "Securing a Web API involves implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms. Common methods include using OAuth 2.0 and JWT for token-based authentication, enforcing HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, and implementing role-based access control to restrict access to specific endpoints. Additionally, measures like input validation and rate limiting help secure the API."

**3. Explain the concept of REST and its principles.**

Sample Answer: "REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. Its principles include statelessness (each request is independent), resource-based URLs, standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and using HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests. RESTful APIs are designed to be simple, scalable, and easily consumed by various clients."

**4. How do you handle versioning in Web APIs?**

Sample Answer: "Versioning in Web APIs can be handled using different strategies: URL versioning (including the version number in the URL path), query string versioning (adding a version parameter to the query string), and header versioning (specifying the version in the HTTP header). Each method has its pros and cons, and the choice depends on the specific use case and client requirements."

**5. Describe how you would implement pagination in a Web API.**

Sample Answer: "To implement pagination in a Web API, I would include parameters for page number and page size in the API request. The API method would then use these parameters to fetch a subset of data from the database. Additionally, I would include metadata in the response, such as the total number of items and the total number of pages, to help clients navigate through the data. For example, `GET /api/items?pageNumber=1&pageSize=10` would return the first 10 items."

### **Additional C# and ASP.Net Core, Entity Framework, Web API Questions**

**6. How do you manage state in an ASP.Net Core application?**

Sample Answer: "In ASP.Net Core, state can be managed using several methods depending on the scope and duration of the state: session state for user-specific data, application state for global data, caching for temporary data storage, and cookies for client-side storage. Additionally, for distributed applications, state can be managed using distributed caches like Redis."

**7. What are the benefits of using async and await in C#?**

Sample Answer: "The async and await keywords in C# simplify asynchronous programming by allowing code to run asynchronously without blocking the main thread. This leads to more responsive applications, especially for I/O-bound operations. It also makes the code more readable and maintainable compared to traditional asynchronous programming using callbacks or manual thread management."

**8. How do you configure logging in an ASP.Net Core application?**

Sample Answer: "Logging in ASP.Net Core is configured in the `Startup.cs` file using the `ILogger` interface and built-in logging providers like Console, Debug, and EventSource. Configuration settings can be specified in `appsettings.json`. Third-party logging frameworks like Serilog and NLog can also be integrated for more advanced logging scenarios."

**9. Explain the concept of middleware in ASP.Net Core and provide an example of custom middleware.**

Sample Answer: "Middleware in ASP.Net Core is software that's assembled into an application pipeline to handle requests and responses. Each middleware component chooses whether to pass the request to the next component. An example of custom middleware would be logging request details. In `Startup.cs`, you define the middleware in the `Configure` method: `app.Use(async (context, next) => { /* log details */ await next.Invoke(); /* log details */ });`."

**10. How do you implement dependency injection in ASP.Net Core?**

Sample Answer: "Dependency injection in ASP.Net Core is configured in the `Startup.cs` file within the `ConfigureServices` method. Services are registered with lifetimes (transient, scoped, singleton) using methods like `services.AddTransient`, `services.AddScoped`, or `services.AddSingleton`. These services are then injected into controllers or other classes via constructor injection."

### **Advanced C# Questions**

1. What is the purpose of the `using` statement in C#?

Sample Answer: "The `using` statement is used to ensure that objects implementing the `IDisposable` interface are disposed of as soon as they go out of scope. This is crucial for managing unmanaged resources like file handles, database connections, and network streams, ensuring they are released properly."

2. Explain the difference between `readonly` and `const` in C#.

Sample Answer: "`const` fields are compile-time constants and their values are fixed at compile time. They must be assigned at the time of declaration. `readonly` fields are runtime constants and can be assigned either at the time of declaration or in the constructor of the class."

3. What are generics in C# and why are they useful?

Sample Answer: "Generics allow you to define classes, methods, and data structures with a placeholder for the type of data they store or use. This increases type safety and performance by reducing the need for boxing/unboxing and allows code reusability without sacrificing type specificity."

4. How does the `yield` keyword work in C#?

Sample Answer: "The `yield` keyword is used to create an iterator method that returns a sequence of values one at a time. It allows the method to maintain its state between calls and is particularly useful for implementing custom iteration logic."

5. What is reflection in C# and when would you use it?

Sample Answer: "Reflection allows you to inspect and interact with the metadata of assemblies, types, and members at runtime. It can be used for tasks like dynamically creating instances, invoking methods, and accessing attributes, often used in scenarios requiring late binding or plugin architectures."

6. Explain covariance and contravariance in C#.

Sample Answer: "Covariance and contravariance enable implicit reference conversion for generic type parameters. Covariance (`out` keyword) allows you to assign a more derived type to a less derived type, whereas contravariance (`in` keyword) allows you to assign a less derived type to a more derived type."

7. What are extension methods in C#?

Sample Answer: "Extension methods allow you to add new methods to existing types without modifying their source code. They are defined as static methods in a static class, with the `this` keyword as the first parameter, indicating the type they extend."

8. How does async/await work in C#?

Sample Answer: "The `async` keyword indicates that a method contains asynchronous operations. The `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of the method until the awaited task completes, without blocking the main thread. This simplifies asynchronous programming by avoiding callbacks."

9. What is a delegate in C# and how is it different from an event?

Sample Answer: "A delegate is a type that represents references to methods with a specific parameter list and return type. An event is a special delegate designed for event handling. Delegates can be invoked directly, whereas events can only be invoked from within the class that declares them."

10. What is the difference between `Array` and `ArrayList` in C#?

Sample Answer: "An `Array` is a fixed-size, strongly-typed collection of elements, whereas `ArrayList` is a dynamically sized, non-generic collection of objects. `ArrayList` stores elements as objects, which requires boxing/unboxing for value types, impacting performance."

11. How does garbage collection work in .NET?

Sample Answer: "Garbage collection in .NET is an automatic memory management process that identifies and reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. The GC operates in three generations to optimize performance: Generation 0 for short-lived objects, Generation 1 for mid-lived objects, and Generation 2 for long-lived objects."

12. What is a `Tuple` in C# and when would you use it?

Sample Answer: "A `Tuple` is a data structure that can hold multiple values of different types. It is useful for returning multiple values from a method without using out parameters or defining a custom class. `Tuple` types are immutable and their elements can be accessed using properties like `Item1`, `Item2`, etc."

13. Explain the concept of immutability in C#.

Sample Answer: "Immutability means that once an object is created, its state cannot be changed. In C#, strings are immutable, meaning any modification results in the creation of a new string object. Immutability ensures thread-safety and simplifies reasoning about the state of objects."

14. What are nullable types in C# and how are they used?

Sample Answer: "Nullable types allow value types to represent `null` values. They are declared using the `?` syntax, e.g., `int?`. Nullable types are useful in scenarios where you need to differentiate between a default value and the absence of a value."

15. How does dependency injection work in C#?

Sample Answer: "Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) by injecting dependencies into a class rather than having the class create them. In C#, DI is commonly implemented using frameworks like ASP.Net Core's built-in DI container, where services are registered in the `ConfigureServices` method and injected via constructors."

16. Explain the concept of method overloading and overriding in C#.

Sample Answer: "Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists within the same class. Method overriding involves redefining a base class method in a derived class using the `override` keyword, allowing the derived class to provide a specific implementation."

17. What is the `lock` statement in C# and when would you use it?

Sample Answer: "The `lock` statement is used to ensure that a block of code is executed by only one thread at a time, preventing race conditions. It is used when accessing shared resources in a multi-threaded environment to ensure thread safety."

18. Describe the purpose of attributes in C#.

Sample Answer: "Attributes provide a way to add metadata to code elements (classes, methods, properties, etc.). They are used to convey information to the compiler or runtime about behaviors or characteristics, such as marking methods as obsolete with the `[Obsolete]` attribute or specifying serialization options with `[DataContract]`."

19. What are generics constraints in C#?

Sample Answer: "Generics constraints in C# restrict the types that can be used with a generic type parameter. Constraints include `where T : struct` (value type), `where T : class` (reference type), `where T : new()` (parameterless constructor), and `where T : BaseClass` (specific base type). These constraints provide type safety and enable more specific operations within generic classes or methods."

20. Explain the concept of boxing and unboxing in C#.

Sample Answer: "Boxing is the process of converting a value type to a reference type by wrapping the value in a heap-allocated object. Unboxing is the reverse process of extracting the value type from the object. While boxing and unboxing provide flexibility, they incur performance overhead due to heap allocation and type casting."

### **Advanced ASP.Net Core Questions**

1. What is the purpose of the `Startup` class in an ASP.Net Core application?

Sample Answer: "The `Startup` class is responsible for configuring the services and the request pipeline of an ASP.Net Core application. It contains two main methods: `ConfigureServices`, where services are registered with the DI container, and `Configure`, where the HTTP request pipeline is defined using middleware."

2. How do you handle cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in ASP.Net Core?

Sample Answer: "In ASP.Net Core, CORS is handled using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cors` package. You can enable CORS in the `ConfigureServices` method by calling `services.AddCors` and configuring policies. In the `Configure` method, you use `app.UseCors` to apply the policies to incoming requests."

3. Explain how routing works in ASP.Net Core.

Sample Answer: "Routing in ASP.Net Core is used to map incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controller actions. It can be configured using attribute routing, where route templates are specified directly on controller actions, or convention-based routing, defined in the `Configure` method using the `UseEndpoints` middleware. Routes can also include constraints and default values."

4. What is middleware in ASP.Net Core, and how do you create custom middleware?

Sample Answer: "Middleware in ASP.Net Core is a component that processes HTTP requests and responses. It is used to handle tasks like authentication, logging, and error handling. Custom middleware is created by defining a class with an `Invoke` or `InvokeAsync` method, and it is registered in the `Configure` method of the `Startup` class using `app.UseMiddleware<CustomMiddleware>`."

5. How do you configure logging in an ASP.Net Core application?

Sample Answer: "Logging in ASP.Net Core is configured using the `ILogger` interface and the built-in logging providers (Console, Debug, EventSource). Configuration settings are specified in the `appsettings.json` file. Third-party logging frameworks like Serilog and NLog can also be integrated by installing the appropriate packages and configuring them in the `Startup` class."

6. What is the difference between `IApplicationBuilder` and `IServiceCollection` in ASP.Net Core?

Sample Answer: "`IApplicationBuilder` is used to configure the request pipeline by adding middleware components, while `IServiceCollection` is used to register services with the DI container. `IApplicationBuilder` is typically configured in the `Configure` method of the `Startup` class, and `IServiceCollection` is configured in the `ConfigureServices` method."

7. Explain the concept of dependency injection (DI) in ASP.Net Core.

Sample Answer: "Dependency injection (DI) in ASP.Net Core is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) by injecting dependencies into a class rather than having the class create them. ASP.Net Core's built-in DI container allows services to be registered with different lifetimes (transient, scoped, singleton) and injected into constructors of classes."

8. How do you implement authentication and authorization in an ASP.Net Core application?

Sample Answer: "Authentication and authorization in ASP.Net Core are implemented using middleware. For authentication, services like JWT, cookies, or OAuth can be configured using `services.AddAuthentication` and `app.UseAuthentication`. Authorization is configured using `services.AddAuthorization` and policies that define access requirements. The `Authorize` attribute is used to protect controller actions."

9. What are Razor Pages, and how do they differ from MVC?

Sample Answer: "Razor Pages is a page-based programming model in ASP.Net Core that simplifies the development of page-focused scenarios. Unlike MVC, which separates models, views, and controllers, Razor Pages encapsulates the controller and model logic within a single `PageModel` class. This makes it easier to manage the code related to a specific page."

10. How do you handle session state in ASP.Net Core?

Sample Answer: "Session state in ASP.Net Core is handled using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Session` package. It is configured in the `Startup` class by calling `services.AddSession` in `ConfigureServices` and `app.UseSession` in `Configure`. Session data is stored in key-value pairs and can be accessed using the `HttpContext.Session` property."

11. What is the purpose of the `IHostedService` interface in ASP.Net Core?

Sample Answer: "`IHostedService` is an interface used to implement background services in ASP.Net Core applications. It defines two methods, `StartAsync` and `StopAsync`, which are called by the runtime to manage the lifecycle of the hosted service. `IHostedService` is commonly used for tasks like background processing and scheduled tasks."

12. Explain the difference between `AddSingleton`, `AddScoped`, and `AddTransient` in ASP.Net Core.

Sample Answer: "`AddSingleton` registers a service with a singleton lifetime, meaning a single instance is created and shared throughout the application's lifetime. `AddScoped` registers a service with a scoped lifetime, meaning a new instance is created per request. `AddTransient` registers a service with a transient lifetime, meaning a new instance is created each time the service is requested."

13. How do you handle file uploads in an ASP.Net Core application?

Sample Answer: "File uploads in ASP.Net Core are handled using the `IFormFile` interface. The uploaded files can be accessed through action parameters in controller methods. The files can be saved to the server using methods like `CopyTo` or `CopyToAsync`. Additionally, validation and security measures should be implemented to prevent malicious file uploads."

14. What is the purpose of the `Configure` and `ConfigureServices` methods in the `Startup` class?

Sample Answer: "`ConfigureServices` is used to register services with the DI container, defining the services and their lifetimes. `Configure` is used to define the request processing pipeline by adding middleware components. Both methods are essential for configuring the application's behavior and dependencies."

15. How do you use filters in ASP.Net Core MVC?

Sample Answer: "Filters in ASP.Net Core MVC are used to run code before or after specific stages in the request processing pipeline. They can be applied globally, at the controller level, or at the action level. ASP.Net Core provides built-in filters like authorization, action, result, and exception filters. Custom filters can be created by implementing the corresponding filter interfaces."

16. Explain the concept of model binding in ASP.Net Core MVC.

Sample Answer: "Model binding in ASP.Net Core MVC is the process of mapping HTTP request data (query strings, form data, route values) to action method parameters and model properties. This allows developers to work with strongly-typed objects instead of raw request data. Custom model binders can be created to handle complex binding scenarios."

17. How do you implement global exception handling in an ASP.Net Core application?

Sample Answer: "Global exception handling in ASP.Net Core is implemented using middleware. A custom middleware component can be created to catch exceptions and handle them appropriately. This component is added to the request pipeline in the `Configure` method using `app.UseMiddleware<ExceptionHandlingMiddleware>`. Alternatively, the built-in `UseExceptionHandler` middleware can be used."

18. What is the purpose of the `ViewComponent` in ASP.Net Core MVC?

Sample Answer: "A `ViewComponent` is a reusable component in ASP.Net Core MVC that encapsulates rendering logic and can be used within views. It is similar to a partial view but with additional logic encapsulated in a class. View components are used to create modular and reusable UI elements."

19. How do you implement localization in an ASP.Net Core application?

Sample Answer: "Localization in ASP.Net Core is implemented using the `Microsoft.Extensions.Localization` package. Services are configured in the `ConfigureServices` method using `services.AddLocalization` and `services.Configure<RequestLocalizationOptions>`.

20. How do you handle configuration settings in an ASP.Net Core application?

Sample Answer: "Configuration settings in ASP.Net Core are managed using the `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration` package. Settings are typically stored in `appsettings.json`, environment variables, or other configuration sources. The `Configuration` object is used to access these settings, and they can be injected into classes using options pattern (`IOptions<T>`)."

### **Advanced Entity Framework Questions**

1. What are the different approaches to handling concurrency in Entity Framework?

Sample Answer: "Concurrency in Entity Framework can be handled using optimistic concurrency, where a concurrency token (e.g., timestamp or version column) is used to detect conflicts. When a conflict is detected, an exception is thrown, allowing the application to handle it (e.g., retry, merge changes). Pessimistic concurrency, which involves locking the data, is less commonly used in EF."

2. How do you implement complex type mappings in Entity Framework?

Sample Answer: "Complex type mappings in Entity Framework are implemented using the `ComplexType` attribute or the Fluent API. Complex types are value objects that do not have an identity and are used to group multiple properties into a single unit. They are mapped to columns in the same table as the owning entity."

3. Explain how to use the Fluent API to configure relationships in Entity Framework.

Sample Answer: "The Fluent API is used to configure entity relationships in EF Core. It provides a more flexible way to define mappings than data annotations. Relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) are configured in the `OnModelCreating` method using methods like `HasOne`, `HasMany`, `WithOne`, and `WithMany`. Additional settings like cascade delete and foreign keys can also be configured."

4. What is the purpose of the `DbContext` class in Entity Framework?

Sample Answer: "`DbContext` is the primary class in Entity Framework that manages database connections and transactions, and provides methods for querying and saving data. It acts as a bridge between the domain model and the database, enabling CRUD operations and change tracking."

5. How do you handle database migrations in Entity Framework Core?

Sample Answer: "Database migrations in EF Core are handled using the `Add-Migration` and `Update-Database` commands in the Package Manager Console or CLI. Migrations allow incremental updates to the database schema based on changes in the data model. Migration scripts can be customized, and the `DbContext` can be configured to apply migrations automatically on startup."

6. Explain the difference between `DbSet` and `DbQuery` in Entity Framework Core.

Sample Answer: "`DbSet` represents a collection of entities that can be queried and modified, supporting CRUD operations. `DbQuery` represents a read-only query against the database, typically used for mapping to views or complex queries that do not involve modifications. `DbQuery` was introduced in EF Core and is now deprecated in favor of using `FromSqlRaw` or `FromSqlInterpolated` methods."

7. How do you configure cascade delete in Entity Framework?

Sample Answer: "Cascade delete is configured using the Fluent API or data annotations. In the Fluent API, the `OnDelete` method is used to specify cascade delete behavior for relationships (`DeleteBehavior.Cascade`). This ensures that related entities are automatically deleted when the principal entity is deleted."

8. What are shadow properties in Entity Framework Core?

Sample Answer: "Shadow properties are properties that are not defined in the .NET class but are defined in the EF Core model. They are used to store additional data in the database without modifying the domain class. Shadow properties are configured using the Fluent API and accessed using the `EF.Property` method."

9. How do you handle transactions in Entity Framework?

Sample Answer: "Transactions in Entity Framework are handled using the `DbContext.Database.BeginTransaction` method to start a transaction, `CommitTransaction` to commit it, and `RollbackTransaction` to roll it back in case of an error. This ensures that multiple operations are executed as a single unit of work, maintaining data integrity."

10. What are global query filters in Entity Framework Core?

Sample Answer: "Global query filters are filters applied to all queries for a specific entity type. They are used to enforce multi-tenancy, soft deletes, or other business rules. Global query filters are configured using the Fluent API in the `OnModelCreating` method with the `HasQueryFilter` method."

11. Explain how to use raw SQL queries in Entity Framework Core.

Sample Answer: "Raw SQL queries in EF Core are executed using the `FromSqlRaw` or `FromSqlInterpolated` methods on `DbSet`. These methods allow executing raw SQL queries directly against the database and mapping the results to entity types. Raw SQL queries are useful for complex queries that are not easily expressed with LINQ."

12. How do you handle inheritance in Entity Framework?

Sample Answer: "Inheritance in Entity Framework is handled using three strategies: Table-per-Hierarchy (TPH), where a single table is used for all derived types with a discriminator column; Table-per-Type (TPT), where each type has its own table; and Table-per-Concrete-Class (TPC), where each concrete class has its own table. These strategies are configured using the Fluent API."

13. What is change tracking in Entity Framework, and how does it work?

Sample Answer: "Change tracking in Entity Framework is the process of keeping track of changes made to entity objects so that the context can persist those changes to the database. EF Core automatically tracks changes to entities retrieved from the database and updates their state (Added, Modified, Deleted) as they are modified in code. This information is used when `SaveChanges` is called to generate the appropriate SQL commands."

14. How do you configure composite keys in Entity Framework?

Sample Answer: "Composite keys in Entity Framework are configured using the Fluent API. In the `OnModelCreating` method, the `HasKey` method is used to specify the properties that form the composite key. Composite keys are useful for entities where a single column is not sufficient to uniquely identify a record."

15. Explain the difference between eager loading and lazy loading in Entity Framework Core.

Sample Answer: "Eager loading retrieves related entities as part of the initial query using the `Include` method, reducing the number of database calls. Lazy loading defers the loading of related entities until they are accessed, which can lead to multiple database calls (N+1 problem). Explicit loading is used to load related entities on demand after the initial query."

16. How do you use value converters in Entity Framework Core?

Sample Answer: "Value converters in EF Core are used to transform data between the model and the database. They are configured using the Fluent API with the `HasConversion` method, specifying the conversion logic for the property. Value converters are useful for mapping custom types, encrypting data, or handling data transformations."

17. What is the purpose of `Owned Entity Types` in Entity Framework Core?

Sample Answer: "Owned entity types in EF Core represent types that are conceptually part of another entity and do not have a separate identity. They are configured using the Fluent API with the `OwnsOne` or `OwnsMany` methods. Owned types are useful for modeling complex value objects that are embedded within another entity."

18. How do you handle soft deletes in Entity Framework Core?

Sample Answer: "Soft deletes in EF Core are implemented by adding a `Deleted` flag to the entity and configuring a global query filter to exclude soft-deleted entities from queries. Instead of deleting records from the database, the `Deleted` flag is set to true, allowing the records to be retained for auditing or recovery purposes."

19. What is the purpose of the `AsNoTracking` method in Entity Framework Core?

Sample Answer: "`AsNoTracking` is a method used to query entities without enabling change tracking. This improves performance for read-only queries by skipping the overhead of tracking changes. It is useful for scenarios where the retrieved data is not intended to be modified and saved back to the database."

20. How do you implement batch updates and deletes in Entity Framework Core?

Sample Answer: "Batch updates and deletes in EF Core are implemented using third-party libraries like EFCore.BulkExtensions or by executing raw SQL commands. These libraries provide methods for performing bulk operations efficiently, reducing the number of database round-trips and improving performance."

### **Advanced Web API Questions**

1. What are the best practices for designing RESTful APIs?

Sample Answer: "Best practices for designing RESTful APIs include using meaningful resource-based URIs, standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), appropriate status codes, and hypermedia links (HATEOAS). APIs should also support filtering, pagination, and versioning, and be documented using tools like Swagger."

2. How do you handle versioning in a Web API?

Sample Answer: "Versioning in a Web API can be handled using URL versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/resource`), query string parameters (`/api/resource?version=1`), or custom headers (`Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json`). Each method has its pros and cons, and the choice depends on the specific use case and client requirements."

3. Explain the concept of content negotiation in Web API.

Sample Answer: "Content negotiation is the process by which a Web API selects the appropriate response format based on the client's request headers (e.g., `Accept`). The API can return different representations of the same resource (e.g., JSON, XML) depending on the client's preference. This is typically implemented using formatters in ASP.Net Core."

4. How do you secure a Web API using OAuth 2.0 and JWT?

Sample Answer: "Securing a Web API using OAuth 2.0 involves implementing an authorization server that issues access tokens. JWT (JSON Web Token) is used to represent the access tokens, which are signed and optionally encrypted. The API validates the token on each request, ensuring the client has the necessary permissions. ASP.Net Core provides middleware to handle JWT validation."

5. How do you implement caching in a Web API?

Sample Answer: "Caching in a Web API can be implemented using response caching, in-memory caching, or distributed caching (e.g., Redis). Response caching involves setting appropriate cache headers (`Cache-Control`, `Expires`) to cache responses on the client or intermediate proxies. In-memory and distributed caching store data on the server, reducing the need to fetch data from the database on subsequent requests."

6. What is the difference between SOAP and REST?

Sample Answer: "SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services, using XML-based messaging. It includes built-in error handling and supports various transport protocols (HTTP, SMTP, etc.). REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods and resource-based URIs. REST is simpler and more flexible, typically using JSON for data exchange, but does not have built-in standards for security or error handling like SOAP."

7. How do you implement rate limiting in a Web API?

Sample Answer: "Rate limiting in a Web API is implemented to control the number of requests a client can make in a specified time period. This can be achieved using middleware that tracks client requests and enforces limits based on IP address or API key. ASP.Net Core has middleware like `AspNetCoreRateLimit` for implementing rate limiting policies."

8. Explain how to handle file uploads and downloads in a Web API.

Sample Answer: "File uploads in a Web API are handled using the `IFormFile` interface to receive the file from the client. The file can be saved to the server using methods like `CopyToAsync`. For downloads, the API returns a `FileResult` with the appropriate content type and file stream. It's important to implement security measures to prevent malicious files and unauthorized access."

9. What is HATEOAS and how is it implemented in a Web API?

Sample Answer: "HATEOAS (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State) is a constraint of REST APIs that provides hypermedia links within the responses to guide clients on possible actions. It is implemented by including links to related resources and actions in the API responses. This helps clients navigate the API dynamically without relying on hardcoded URIs."

10. How do you handle validation in a Web API?

Sample Answer: "Validation in a Web API is handled using data annotations on models and custom validation logic in action methods. ASP.Net Core provides built-in attributes like `[Required]`, `[Range]`, and `[StringLength]` for model validation. Custom validation attributes and filters can be created for more complex scenarios. The `ModelState.IsValid` property is checked in action methods to ensure valid input."

11. Explain the use of action filters in ASP.Net Core Web API.

Sample Answer: "Action filters in ASP.Net Core Web API are used to run code before or after the execution of action methods. They are applied using attributes (`[ActionFilter]`) and can be used for tasks like logging, authentication, and input validation. Custom action filters are created by implementing the `IActionFilter` or `IAsyncActionFilter` interfaces."

12. How do you implement dependency injection in a Web API?

Sample Answer: "Dependency injection in a Web API is implemented using ASP.Net Core's built-in DI container. Services are registered in the `ConfigureServices` method of the `Startup` class using `AddTransient`, `AddScoped`, or `AddSingleton` methods. These services are then injected into controllers and other classes via constructor injection."

13. What are the different HTTP status codes and their meanings?

Sample Answer: "HTTP status codes indicate the result of a client's request to the server. Some common status codes include:

* 200 OK: The request was successful.
* 201 Created: A resource was successfully created.
* 400 Bad Request: The request was invalid.
* 401 Unauthorized: Authentication is required.
* 403 Forbidden: The client does not have permission.
* 404 Not Found: The requested resource was not found.
* 500 Internal Server Error: An error occurred on the server."

14. How do you implement logging and monitoring in a Web API?

Sample Answer: "Logging in a Web API is implemented using ASP.Net Core's built-in logging framework (`ILogger`) or third-party libraries like Serilog. Logs can be written to various sinks (console, file, database). Monitoring involves using tools like Application Insights or Prometheus to track API performance, request metrics, and error rates. Health checks can be implemented using the `Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks` package."

15. Explain the concept of middleware in ASP.Net Core Web API.

Sample Answer: "Middleware in ASP.Net Core Web API is a component that processes HTTP requests and responses. Middleware is configured in the `Configure` method of the `Startup` class and executed in a pipeline. Each middleware component can perform tasks like logging, authentication, and error handling, and can pass the request to the next component or short-circuit the pipeline."

16. How do you handle exceptions globally in a Web API?

Sample Answer: "Global exception handling in a Web API is implemented using middleware. A custom middleware component can be created to catch exceptions and return appropriate error responses. This component is added to the request pipeline in the `Configure` method using `app.UseMiddleware<ExceptionHandlingMiddleware>`. Alternatively, the built-in `UseExceptionHandler` middleware can be used."

17. What is the purpose of the `ApiController` attribute in ASP.Net Core Web API?

Sample Answer: "The `ApiController` attribute is used to annotate a controller class in ASP.Net Core Web API. It provides several benefits, including automatic model validation, binding source inference (e.g., `[FromBody]`, `[FromQuery]`), and consistent response handling (e.g., `BadRequest` for invalid models). This attribute simplifies the development of RESTful APIs."

18. How do you implement authentication and authorization in a Web API?

Sample Answer: "Authentication in a Web API is implemented using middleware like JWT bearer authentication or OAuth 2.0. Services are configured in the `ConfigureServices` method using `AddAuthentication` and `AddAuthorization`, and the middleware is added in the `Configure` method using `UseAuthentication` and `UseAuthorization`. Authorization policies can be defined to restrict access to certain endpoints based on user roles or claims."

19. Explain the use of `IActionResult` in ASP.Net Core Web API.

Sample Answer: "`IActionResult` is an interface that represents the result of an action method in ASP.Net Core Web API. It provides flexibility in returning different types of responses, such as `Ok`, `BadRequest`, `NotFound`, `Created`, etc. Action methods can return specific implementations of `IActionResult` to indicate the outcome of the request."

20. How do you handle asynchronous operations in a Web API?

Sample Answer: "Asynchronous operations in a Web API are handled using the `async` and `await` keywords in action methods. This allows the API to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking threads, improving scalability and performance. Asynchronous methods typically return `Task<IActionResult>` or `Task<T>` for the response."
