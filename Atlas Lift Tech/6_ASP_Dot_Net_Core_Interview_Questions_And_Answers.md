### ASP.Net Core Interview Questions and Answers:

1. **What are the main features of ASP.Net Core?**
   - **Answer:** ASP.Net Core is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected applications. Key features include:
     - Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, and Linux)
     - Unified MVC and Web API framework
     - Dependency injection built-in
     - Modular and lightweight
     - High performance and scalability
     - Asynchronous programming support
     - Built-in support for modern front-end frameworks
     - Integration with various client-side libraries and frameworks

2. **Explain the concept of middleware in ASP.Net Core.**
   - **Answer:** Middleware is software that's assembled into an application pipeline to handle requests and responses. Each component in the pipeline can either process the request and pass it on to the next component or terminate the request. Common middleware tasks include authentication, logging, error handling, and request/response transformations.

3. **How do you configure routing in ASP.Net Core?**
   - **Answer:** Routing is configured in the `Startup` class within the `Configure` method using `IEndpointRouteBuilder`. You can define routes for controllers, Razor Pages, and other endpoints.
     ```csharp
     public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
     {
         app.UseRouting();

         app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
         {
             endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
                 name: "default",
                 pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
             endpoints.MapRazorPages();
         });
     }
     ```

4. **What is dependency injection and how is it implemented in ASP.Net Core?**
   - **Answer:** Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control), allowing dependencies to be injected into a class rather than being instantiated within the class. ASP.Net Core has built-in support for DI, configured in the `Startup` class within the `ConfigureServices` method.
     ```csharp
     public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
     {
         services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
     }
     ```

5. **How do you create a RESTful API in ASP.Net Core?**
   - **Answer:** A RESTful API is created using controllers with route attributes to define endpoints. Example:
     ```csharp
     [Route("api/[controller]")]
     [ApiController]
     public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
     {
         [HttpGet]
         public IEnumerable<Product> GetAll() => _repository.GetAll();

         [HttpGet("{id}")]
         public ActionResult<Product> GetById(int id)
         {
             var product = _repository.GetById(id);
             if (product == null) return NotFound();
             return product;
         }

         [HttpPost]
         public IActionResult Create(Product product)
         {
             _repository.Add(product);
             return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetById), new { id = product.Id }, product);
         }
     }
     ```

6. **Explain the difference between ASP.Net Core and ASP.Net MVC.**
   - **Answer:** ASP.Net Core is a complete rewrite of the ASP.Net Framework, designed to be cross-platform, high-performance, and modular. It unifies the ASP.Net MVC and Web API frameworks into a single programming model. ASP.Net MVC is a web application framework for building dynamic web applications using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, but it is limited to Windows.

7. **What is the purpose of the Startup class in ASP.Net Core?**
   - **Answer:** The `Startup` class is used to configure the application's services and middleware. It contains two methods: `ConfigureServices`, where services are added to the DI container, and `Configure`, where the HTTP request pipeline is defined.

8. **How do you implement authentication and authorization in ASP.Net Core?**
   - **Answer:** Authentication and authorization are implemented using middleware and attributes.
     ```csharp
     public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
     {
         services.AddAuthentication(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
                 .AddCookie(options => { /* Cookie options */ });

         services.AddAuthorization(options =>
         {
             options.AddPolicy("AdminOnly", policy => policy.RequireRole("Admin"));
         });
     }

     public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
     {
         app.UseAuthentication();
         app.UseAuthorization();
     }

     [Authorize(Policy = "AdminOnly")]
     public class AdminController : Controller
     {
         // Actions
     }
     ```

9. **What are Razor Pages and how do they differ from MVC?**
   - **Answer:** Razor Pages is a page-based programming model in ASP.Net Core that makes building web applications easier and more productive. Unlike MVC, which uses controllers and views, Razor Pages uses a single file per "page" with embedded C# code and markup.

10. **How do you handle configuration settings in ASP.Net Core?**
    - **Answer:** Configuration settings are managed using the `appsettings.json` file, environment variables, and the `IConfiguration` interface.
      ```csharp
      public class Startup
      {
          public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }
          
          public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
          {
              Configuration = configuration;
          }
          
          public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
          {
              services.Configure<MySettings>(Configuration.GetSection("MySettings"));
          }
      }
      ```

11. **Explain the concept of model binding in ASP.Net Core.**
    - **Answer:** Model binding in ASP.Net Core automatically maps data from HTTP requests (like form values, route data, query strings) to action method parameters or model properties. This simplifies the process of handling and validating user input.

12. **How do you use Entity Framework Core in ASP.Net Core?**
    - **Answer:** Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is used as an ORM to interact with databases. It is configured in the `Startup` class, and a DbContext class is created to represent the database.
      ```csharp
      public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
      {
          services.AddDbContext<MyDbContext>(options =>
              options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
      }

      public class MyDbContext : DbContext
      {
          public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
      }
      ```

13. **What is the purpose of the `IApplicationBuilder` interface in ASP.Net Core?**
    - **Answer:** The `IApplicationBuilder` interface is used to configure the application's request pipeline. It is typically used in the `Configure` method of the `Startup` class to add middleware components.

14. **How do you manage session state in ASP.Net Core?**
    - **Answer:** Session state is managed using middleware. You configure session services in `ConfigureServices` and add session middleware in `Configure`.
      ```csharp
      public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
      {
          services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();
          services.AddSession();
      }

      public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
      {
          app.UseSession();
      }
      ```

15. **Explain the concept of filters in ASP.Net Core.**
    - **Answer:** Filters in ASP.Net Core are used to execute code before or after certain stages in the request processing pipeline. They can be used for tasks like authorization, caching, exception handling, and logging.
      ```csharp
      public class MyActionFilter : IActionFilter
      {
          public void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context) { }
          public void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context) { }
      }

      [ServiceFilter(typeof(MyActionFilter))]
      public class HomeController : Controller
      {
          // Actions
      }
      ```

16. **How do you handle errors and exceptions in ASP.Net Core?**
    - **Answer:** Errors and exceptions are handled using middleware. You can use `UseExceptionHandler` for global error handling and `UseStatusCodePages` for handling status codes.
      ```csharp
      public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
      {
          app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
          app.UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute("/Home/Error", "?statusCode={0}");
      }
      ```

17. **What are Tag Helpers in ASP.Net Core?**
    - **Answer:** Tag Helpers are a feature in ASP.Net Core MVC that enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor views. They make it easier to produce and work with HTML markup.

18. **How do you implement logging in ASP.Net Core?**
    - **Answer:** Logging is implemented using the built-in logging framework. It is configured in the `Startup` class and uses the `ILogger` interface.
      ```csharp
      public class HomeController : Controller
      {
          private readonly ILogger<HomeController> _logger;

          public HomeController(ILogger<HomeController> logger)
          {
              _logger = logger;
          }

          public IActionResult Index()
          {
              _logger.LogInformation("Index page has been accessed.");
              return View();
          }
      }
      ```

19. **How do you deploy an ASP.Net Core application?**
    - **Answer:** ASP.Net Core applications can be deployed in various ways, including:
      - Hosting on IIS
      - Using Kestrel with a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx or Apache)
      - Deploying to cloud services like Azure App Service, AWS, or Google Cloud
      - Using Docker containers
      Deployment typically involves publishing the application to a target environment using command-line tools, Visual Studio, or CI/CD pipelines.

20. **What is the role of the `HostBuilder` class in ASP.Net Core?**
    - **Answer:** The `HostBuilder` class is used to configure and

 build a web host, which is responsible for hosting the application. It sets up the server, request processing pipeline, logging, and dependency injection.
      ```csharp
      public class Program
      {
          public static void Main(string[] args)
          {
              CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
          }

          public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
              Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                  .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
                  {
                      webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
                  });
      }
      ```
