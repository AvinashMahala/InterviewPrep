     - **Azure Portal:** UI-based management.
     - **Azure CLI:** Command-line management with `az sql db create`.
     - **Azure PowerShell:** Using PowerShell cmdlets like `New-AzSqlDatabase`.
     - **T-SQL:** Using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio.

3. **What are the key features of Azure SQL Server?**
   - **Answer:** Key features include:
     - High availability and automatic backups.
     - Scalability with different service tiers.
     - Advanced security features like data encryption and auditing.
     - Integration with Azure services.
     - Automatic patching and updates.
     - Built-in intelligence for performance optimization.

4. **How do you implement security in Azure SQL Server?**
   - **Answer:** Security can be implemented using:
     - **Azure Active Directory (AAD):** For authentication and authorization.

     - **Always Encrypted:** Protects sensitive data within client applications.
     - **Firewall Rules:** Restrict access to specific IP addresses.
     - **SQL Auditing:** Tracks database events and writes them to an audit log.
     - **Data Masking:** Masks sensitive data in query results.

5. **Explain the concept of elastic pools in Azure SQL Server.**
   - **Answer:** Elastic pools allow multiple databases to share resources (DTUs or vCores) within a single pool, providing cost-effective management and scaling. It is ideal for managing variable and unpredictable workloads across multiple databases.

6. **How do you perform backup and restore operations in Azure SQL Server?**
   - **Answer:** Backups are automatically managed by Azure, providing point-in-time restore capabilities. Manual backups can also be created using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or PowerShell. Restores can be performed from automatic backups

 or manual backups as needed.

7. **How do you optimize performance in Azure SQL Server?**
   - **Answer:** Performance optimization includes:
     - **Using Performance Recommendations:** Automated tuning suggestions from Azure.
     - **Query Optimization:** Using the Query Performance Insights tool to identify slow queries.
     - **Indexing:** Creating and maintaining indexes.
     - **Scaling Resources:** Adjusting service tiers and resource allocations based on workload.
     - **Monitoring and Diagnostics:** Using built-in monitoring tools and telemetry.

8. **What are the different pricing tiers available in Azure SQL Server?**
   - **Answer:** Pricing tiers include:
     - **Basic:** For small databases with light workloads.
     - **Standard:** For typical workloads with balanced compute and storage.
     - **Premium:** For high-performance and mission-critical workloads.
     - **Hyperscale:** For very large databases with rapid scaling and high throughput.

9. **How do you implement high availability and disaster recovery in Azure SQL Server?**
   - **Answer:** High availability and disaster recovery are implemented using:
     - **Geo-Replication:** Creating readable secondary databases in different regions.
     - **Automatic Failover Groups:** For automatic failover of databases between primary and secondary regions.
     - **Active Geo-Replication:** For creating up to four readable secondary replicas.

10. **What is the role of Azure SQL Database Managed Instance?**
    - **Answer:** Azure SQL Database Managed Instance provides a fully managed SQL Server instance with near 100% compatibility with the on-premises SQL Server. It offers more control over the SQL Server environment and supports features like SQL Agent, cross-database queries, and native VNET integration.

11. **How do you integrate Azure SQL Server with other Azure services?**
    - **Answer:** Integration can be done using:
      - **Azure Logic Apps and Azure Data Factory:** For data movement and transformation.
      - **Azure Functions:** For serverless processing.
      - **Azure Machine Learning:** For advanced analytics.
      - **Power BI:** For business intelligence and reporting.

12. **Explain the concept of dynamic data masking in Azure SQL Server.**
    - **Answer:** Dynamic data masking limits the exposure of sensitive data by masking it to non-privileged users. Masking rules can be applied to specific columns to obfuscate data in query results without changing the actual data in the database.

13. **How do you handle data migration to Azure SQL Server?**
    - **Answer:** Data migration can be handled using:
      - **Azure Database Migration Service (DMS):** For automated migration from on-premises or other cloud providers.
      - **Data Migration Assistant (DMA):** For assessing and migrating databases.
      - **Backup and Restore:** For migrating databases using backup files.

14. **What are some common use cases for Azure SQL Server?**
    - **Answer:** Common use cases include:
      - Web and mobile applications.
      - Business applications.
      - Data warehousing.
      - IoT applications.
      - Business intelligence and reporting.

15. **How do you monitor and manage Azure SQL Server?**
    - **Answer:** Monitoring and management can be done using:
      - **Azure Monitor:** For metrics and diagnostics.
      - **SQL Analytics:** For advanced monitoring and analysis.
      - **SQL Insights:** For query performance insights.
      - **Azure Advisor:** For recommendations on best practices.

16. **Explain the concept of geo-replication in Azure SQL Server.**
