     - **Visual Studio:** Direct deployment from the IDE.
     - **Continuous Deployment:** Integration with GitHub, Bitbucket, or Azure Repos.
     - **FTP/SFTP:** File transfer for deployment.

3. **What is the difference between Web Apps, Mobile Apps, API Apps, and Logic Apps in Azure App Service?**
   - **Answer:**
     - **Web Apps:** Host web applications and sites.
     - **Mobile Apps:** Host mobile backend services with features like offline sync.
     - **API Apps:** Host RESTful APIs with features like API management and Swagger integration.
     - **Logic Apps:** Automate workflows and integrate applications, data, and services.

4. **How do you configure scaling in Azure App Service?**
   - **Answer:** Scaling can be configured using:
     - **Manual Scaling:** Adjusting the number of instances manually in the Azure portal.
     - **Auto-Scaling:** Configuring rules based on metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage) to automatically adjust the number of instances.

5. **What are deployment slots in Azure App Service?**
   - **Answer:** Deployment slots are live environments for deploying different versions of your web app. They allow for testing in a production-like setting before swapping the staging slot with the production slot, reducing downtime.

6. **How do you manage and configure custom domains in Azure App Service?**
   - **Answer:** Custom domains can be configured by:
     - Purchasing a domain through Azure or a third-party provider.
     - Adding the custom domain in the Azure portal under "Custom domains".
     - Verifying domain ownership and configuring DNS settings.

7. **What is the purpose of App Service Environment (ASE)?**
   - **Answer:** ASE is a fully isolated and dedicated environment for securely running App Service apps at high scale. It is ideal for applications that require high scalability, security, and network isolation.

8. **How do you secure applications hosted in Azure App Service?**
   - **Answer:** Security measures include:
     - Enabling HTTPS and SSL certificates.
     - Using Azure AD for authentication and authorization.
     - Implementing IP restrictions and firewall rules.
     - Using Managed Service Identity (MSI) for secure access to other Azure resources.

9. **Explain the concept of continuous deployment in Azure App Service.**
   - **Answer:** Continuous deployment automates the deployment process, integrating with source control systems like GitHub, Bitbucket, or Azure Repos. When changes are pushed to the repository, the application is automatically built, tested

, and deployed to the App Service.

10. **How do you monitor and troubleshoot applications in Azure App Service?**
    - **Answer:** Monitoring and troubleshooting can be done using:
      - **Azure Monitor:** Collect and analyze logs and metrics.
      - **Application Insights:** Detailed telemetry, performance monitoring, and diagnostics.
      - **Log Stream:** Real-time logging for immediate insights.
      - **Kudu Console:** Advanced diagnostics and troubleshooting tools.

11. **What are the different pricing tiers available for Azure App Service?**
    - **Answer:** Pricing tiers include:
      - **Free and Shared:** Basic tiers for development and testing.
      - **Basic:** Entry-level tier with dedicated resources.
      - **Standard:** Offers auto-scaling and backup capabilities.
      - **Premium:** High-performance tier with advanced features like VNET integration and additional scaling options.
      - **Isolated:** ASE tier for maximum isolation, scalability, and security.

12. **How do you configure application settings and connection strings in Azure App Service?**
    - **Answer:** Application settings and connection strings can be configured in the Azure portal under the "Configuration" section of the App Service. These settings override the corresponding settings in your web.config or appsettings.json files.

13. **Explain the concept of hybrid connections in Azure App Service.**
    - **Answer:** Hybrid connections enable your App Service to access resources in other networks, such as on-premises or other cloud providers, without exposing those resources to the internet. It uses Azure Relay to securely connect to these resources.

14. **How do you implement SSL/TLS for applications in Azure App Service?**
    - **Answer:** SSL/TLS can be implemented by:
      - Obtaining an SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or using the free App Service managed certificate.
      - Binding the SSL certificate to your custom domain in the Azure portal.
      - Enforcing HTTPS traffic in the App Service settings.

15. **What is the purpose of App Service Plan in Azure App Service?**
    - **Answer:** An App Service Plan defines the region, instance size, and pricing tier for an App Service. It determines the compute resources and features available to your App Service apps.

16. **How do you use Azure Functions within Azure App Service?**
    - **Answer:** Azure Functions can be created within an App Service Plan, allowing you to run serverless functions with the same scaling and management features as your other App Service apps.

17. **How do you handle environment-specific configurations in Azure App Service?**
    - **Answer:** Environment-specific configurations can be managed using application settings and connection strings in the Azure portal, which can be different for each deployment slot or environment.

18. **What are the benefits of using Azure App Service over traditional hosting?**
    - **Answer:** Benefits include:
      - Fully managed service with built-in scalability.
      - Integrated CI/CD support.
      - Easy integration with other Azure services.
      - High availability and disaster recovery.
      - Security features like SSL, VNET integration, and Azure AD.
      - Comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics tools.

19. **How do you back up and restore applications in Azure App Service?**
    - **Answer:** Backup and restore can be configured in the Azure portal under the "Backups" section of the App Service. Automated backups can be scheduled, and you can restore the app to a previous state from a backup.

20. **How do you integrate Azure App Service with other Azure services?**
    - **Answer:** Integration can be achieved through:
      - **Managed Service Identity (MSI):** For secure access to other Azure services.
      - **Logic Apps and Azure Functions:** For building workflows and extending functionality.
      - **Azure DevOps:** For CI/CD pipelines.
      - **Azure Monitor and Application Insights:** For monitoring and diagnostics.
