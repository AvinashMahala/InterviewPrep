To prepare for this role, I have observed managers and leaders to understand how to lead a team, and I have developed core skills including communication, problem-solving, delegation, and coaching.

   **Answer:** 
   "I want to be a leader because I will thrive on the position's responsibility. In recent years, when problems arose at work, I always wanted to take ownership of the situation, and my passion for coaching others means that I have the skills needed to get the most out of a team.

3. **Question: Describe your leadership style.**
   
   **Answer:** 
   "My leadership style is a combination of autocratic, transformational, and delegative. When urgent time-sensitive situations occur, I will direct my team on what needs to be done and by when. My transformational leadership style empowers me to support my employer in any changes they want to implement. I will always encourage my team to embrace new initiatives to ensure the business stays one step ahead of its competitors. Finally, my delegation leadership style means I will always allocate tasks to team members based on their strengths and give them the autonomy to complete their work as required."

5. **Question: How do you manage a team?**
   
   **Answer:** 
   "When managing a team, I concentrate on several key areas to succeed. I conduct performance reviews to learn my team's strengths and weaknesses. Performance reviews empower me to delegate effectively, provide suitable training, and remind each team member of their responsibilities and the importance of our core team values. I keep communication channels open, explain the team's short, medium, and long-term goals, and encourage close collaboration. I maintain consistency and treat everyone fairly, allowing everyone to get involved while listening to my team's ideas. I lead by example, praise good work, provide constructive feedback, and encourage honesty in my team so lessons can be learned if mistakes are made."

   "In the first 30 days, I will meet the senior management team to ascertain the company's objectives and to determine my goals and immediate challenges. Next, I will introduce myself to my team and tell them I will observe their work performance for a one-week period. During the one-week observation period, I will note their work ethic, strengths, and areas for improvement. After the initial observation period has ended, I will hold a team meeting to outline my values and expectations of the team, praise the good work I have seen, and give direction on how they can improve before setting objectives for the team to work toward. Finally, in the first 30 days, I will hold performance reviews with all staff members individually to determine their career aspirations, establish their training needs, and define objectives for the next 6 months."

7. **Question: How would you deal with conflict in a team?**

First, I would speak to those involved in the conflict and encourage them to discuss it openly and transparently to reach a solution that benefits the team. Empowering team members to take ownership of conflict reminds them of their responsibility to work productively and harmoniously. If they could not resolve the conflict, I would step in, establish a solution, and direct each team member regarding the action they needed to take to overcome the conflict that prevented them from progressing."

8. **Question: How would you resolve underperformance in a team?**
   
   **Answer:** 
   "To resolve underperformance, I would first identify the root cause by discussing it privately with the team member. I would provide clear and constructive feedback on how they can improve and set measurable goals with timelines. I would also offer support, whether through additional training or resources, to help them meet these goals. Regular check-ins to monitor progress and provide ongoing feedback are crucial. If the performance does not improve despite these efforts, I would follow the company’s disciplinary procedures."

10. **Question: What would you do if we gave you multiple tasks and projects to deliver in a short timeframe?**

11. **Question: What’s the difference between leadership and management?**
    
    **Answer:** 
    "Leadership involves inspiring and motivating people to achieve a vision, whereas management focuses on planning, organizing, and coordinating resources to achieve specific goals.

By recognizing and addressing any underlying issues and fostering a collaborative environment, I would work towards transforming the team’s performance. Regular team-building activities and acknowledging successes can also help improve team morale."

15. **Question: What do you think you will dislike about being a leader?**
    
    **Answer:** 
    "One of the challenges of being a leader can be making tough decisions that may not be popular.

 under a lot of pressure. I took the initiative to organize daily briefings to ensure everyone was aligned and to address any issues promptly.
