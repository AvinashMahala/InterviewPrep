I also want to be a leader because it is the next step in my career development.

3. **Question: Describe your leadership style.**

   "My leadership style is a combination of autocratic, transformational, and delegative. When urgent time-sensitive situations occur, I will direct my team on what needs to be done and by when. My transformational leadership style empowers me to support my employer in any changes they want to implement. I will always encourage my team to embrace new initiatives to ensure the business stays one step ahead of its competitors. Finally, my delegation leadership style means I will always allocate tasks to team members based on their strengths and give them the autonomy to complete their work as required."

4. **Question: What are the essential skills and qualities required to become a leader?**

   **Answer:**
   "To be a competent leader, you must have good communication skills, both written and verbal. Project briefs must be clear and concise, and you need excellent listening skills to understand your team's challenges and needs. You need emotional intelligence, good interpersonal skills to get the most from your team, and outstanding organizing and planning skills to achieve your objectives.

5. **Question: How do you manage a team?**

   **Answer:**
   "When managing a team, I concentrate on several key areas to succeed. I conduct performance reviews to learn my team's strengths and weaknesses. Performance reviews empower me to delegate effectively, provide suitable training, and remind each team member of their responsibilities and the importance of our core team values. I keep communication channels open, explain the team's short, medium, and long-term goals, and encourage close collaboration. I maintain consistency and treat everyone fairly, allowing everyone to get involved while listening to my team's ideas. I lead by example, praise good work, provide constructive feedback, and encourage honesty in my team so lessons can be learned if mistakes are made."

6. **Question: What will you do in the first 30 days of commencing work in this leadership position?**

   **Answer:**
   "In the first 30 days, I will meet the senior management team to ascertain the company's objectives and to determine my goals and immediate challenges. Next, I will introduce myself to my team and tell them I will observe their work performance for a one-week period. During the one-week observation period, I will note their work ethic, strengths, and areas for improvement. After the initial observation period has ended, I will hold a team meeting to outline my values and expectations of the team, praise the good work I have seen, and give direction on how they can improve before setting objectives for the team to work toward. Finally, in the first 30 days, I will hold performance reviews with all staff members individually to determine their career aspirations, establish their training needs, and define objectives for the next 6 months."

7. **Question: How would you deal with conflict in a team?**

   **Answer:**
   "I would deal with conflict quickly and decisively. If I ignored it or failed to act quickly, it would show my team that I lacked the confidence to lead. First, I would speak to those involved in the conflict and encourage them to discuss it openly and transparently to reach a solution that benefits the team. Empowering team members to take ownership of conflict reminds them of their responsibility to work productively and harmoniously. If they could not resolve the conflict, I would step in, establish a solution, and direct each team member regarding the action they needed to take to overcome the conflict that prevented them from progressing."
