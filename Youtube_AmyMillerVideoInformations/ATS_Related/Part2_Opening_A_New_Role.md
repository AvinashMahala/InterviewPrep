### Summary of Key Points

**Introduction:**
- This week's episode focuses on the purpose and functionality of an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).
- Previous video provided an overview of the recruiting lifecycle and the role of an ATS in it.

**ATS Overview:**
- ATS helps track the entire recruiting lifecycle: opening a requisition, accepting applications, interviewing, documenting follow-ups, scheduling, making offers, accepting offers, and onboarding.

**Hiring Manager and Candidate Experience:**
- Both hiring managers and candidates often dislike entering information into the ATS due to infrequent use.
- Hiring managers typically use the ATS only when they need to open a new role or review resumes.

**Opening a New Role:**
- The process starts with a hiring manager being given headcount approval to hire additional employees.
- Hiring managers enter the ATS to create a new requisition, which involves filling out various fields and dropdowns.
- Headcount may be tracked in a separate system that feeds into the ATS.

**Creating a Requisition:**
- Managers select the job family, level, location, and business group from dropdown menus.
- Job descriptions can be typed in, copied from previous roles, or selected from standard templates.
- Internal policies may dictate certain standardized language or information.

**Approval Process:**
- The requisition goes through an approval chain, which can involve multiple people (e.g., recruiters, finance, legal, business leadership).
- Each approver ensures accuracy and compliance with company policies and legal requirements.

**Knockout Questions and Compliance:**
- Recruiters can set up knockout questions and other assessments in the ATS.
- Compliance with local, state, and federal guidelines is crucial, and changes to the requisition after it’s posted require creating a new job posting.

**Conclusion:**
- After approval, the role is made public for candidates to apply.
- The next video will discuss what happens after a role is made public.
