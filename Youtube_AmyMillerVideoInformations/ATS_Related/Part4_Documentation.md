### Summary of Key Points

**Introduction:**
- This video is the third in the ATS miniseries, focusing on the importance of documentation within an ATS.
- Previous videos covered the overview of an ATS and the candidate workflow.

**Types of Documentation in ATS:**
1. **Candidate Documentation:**
   - Includes resumes, application data, assessment results, and other information provided by the candidate.
   - Candidate records can be accessed through various ways, such as email, name, or candidate ID.
   - Sensitive information like EEOC data (race, ethnicity, gender, etc.) is typically not visible to recruiters for decision-making purposes.

2. **User Documentation:**
   - Input by ATS users (recruiters, hiring managers, recruiting coordinators).
   - Includes feedback, interview notes, and other manually added information.
   - Important for maintaining accurate records and ensuring all interactions and decisions are documented.

3. **Automated Documentation:**
   - Generated automatically by the ATS based on actions taken, such as application submissions, interview scheduling, and email communications.
   - Helps track the timeline and status of each candidate's journey.

**Importance of Documentation:**
- Helps recruiters and hiring managers keep track of candidate progress and interactions.
- Essential for compliance and accurate reporting.
- Allows for a seamless transition if a recruiter is unavailable or leaves, as the documented history can be accessed by others.

**Specific Use Cases:**
- Candidate records provide a comprehensive view of all roles a candidate has applied to and their status.
- Automated documentation can include timestamps for actions taken, making it easier to track progress.
- Email sync in some ATS systems allows for tracking all email communications with candidates.

**Practical Benefits:**
