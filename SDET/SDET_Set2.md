****Q1.**** [****What do you understand about ad-hoc testing?****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/adhoc-testing-in-software/)  
Adhoc testing is a type of software testing that is performed informally and randomly after the formal testing is completed to find any loophole in the system. For this reason, it is also known as Random testing or Monkey testing. Adhoc testing is not performed in a structured way so it is not based on any methodological approach.

****Q2.**** [****What’s the between a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) and a Manual Tester?****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-tester-and-sdet/)  
****Tester****  
The tester is the person who performs the testing process on the software to detect the defects. The tester also checks different aspects of the software. Tester doesn’t know the development process of the software. The tester checks whether the software has bugs and defects or not.

****SDET****  
SDET stands for Software Development Engineer in Test. SDET is the person who plays a role in both the development and testing process. SDET knows the internal design and implementation of the software. Tester who can code is known as an SDET.

****Q3.**** [****What are the various types of Software Testing?****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-software-testing/)  
Testing is the process of executing a program to find errors. To make our software perform well it should be error-free. If testing is done successfully it will remove all the errors from the software. There are various types of software testing such as:

Severity is defined as the extent to which a particular defect can create an impact on the software. Severity is a parameter to denote the implication and the impact of the defect on the functionality of the software. 

*   A higher effect of the bug on system functionality will lead to a higher severity level.
*   A QA engineer determines the severity level of a bug.

Priority is defined as a parameter that decides the order in which a defect should be fixed. Defects having a higher priority should be fixed first.
