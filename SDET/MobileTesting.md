### **3) What is the key difference between mobile device testing and mobile application testing?**

Mobile device testing examines a device’s quality – by validating its hardware and software functions.This process aims to test features, i.e., screen, memory, camera, applications. It also consists of factory testing and certification testing.

Alternatively, mobile application testing means testing the mobile application on different mobile devices to ensure its consistency and functionality. After this process, you can measure the targeted application’s quality, whether it is well-suited for the device in terms of hardware, software, network connectivity, etc.

### **4) How many types of mobile applications? What are they?**

There are three types of mobile applications:

*   **Native Application**          
    A native application is a software application built in a specific programming language for the particular device platform, iOS or Android. It can be easily installed into your devices and available in the application store (Google Play for Android and App Store for iOS), for example, WhatsApp or Facebook.
*   **Web Application**          
    A web application runs inside a mobile web browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari using a mobile network or WIFI. For instance, some of the web applications are m.facebook.com, m.gmail.com, etc.
*   **Hybrid Application**          
    A hybrid application is a combination of a native app and a web app. Even though this type of application can be installed on a device just like a native app, it is a web app built with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript and runs in a webview.

### **5) List out the types of mobile app testing**

*   Usability Testing
*   Compatibility Testing
*   Interface Testing
*   Services Testing
*   Low-level resource Testing
*   Performance Testing

### **10) List of the best practices for Android Testing**

*   Developers must prepare the test cases when they are writing the codes simultaneously.
*   All of the test cases should be stored and well-documented for reusability.
*   Apply continuous integration and execute tests once the code is changed
*   Avoid using rooted devices and emulators to achieve the most reliable results

### **11) While planning to perform an end to end mobile testing, what are the primary criteria you have to consider?**

In an end-to-end mobile testing process, QA teams test the entire application from beginning to end to ensure its flow behaves as expected. Throughout these steps, there are some of the many critical requirements to consider:

*   Is the application successfully installed across various mobile models, gadgets, and operating systems?
*   Does the application launch smoothly with or without a network?
*   What are the orientations that the application supports and how do they work?
*   Does the application perform well on different kinds of devices and network scenarios?
*   How does the application respond when it is used? (i.e. response speed and time)

**Performing Mobile Testing**
-----------------------------

### **12) What is the difference between simulators and emulators?**

Both **Emulators** and **Simulators** are virtual devices that are not real phones but have the same functionality as real handsets. The following table shows the significant difference between a simulator and an emulator:



* Objective
  * Simulator : To simulate the internal behavior of the device, not mimic hardware
  * Emulator: To emulate or mimic both hardware and software features
* Internal structure
  * Simulator : Written in a high-level language
  * Emulator: Written in machine-level assembly language
* Debugging capability
  * Simulator : Can be problematic in terms of debugging purpose
  * Emulator: More suitable for debugging purpose

### **16) What is the best way to test different screen sizes of the devices?**

Using emulators is the most effective way in case there are many different screen sizes of devices to test.

### **17) What are the common bugs that would often be found during the mobile testing process?**

In general, some mobile testers classify the most frequently-found bugs into the four types:

*   **Critical bugs:** The device’s operating system crashes when testing the application’s particular feature.
*   **Block bugs:** Unresponsiveness of performance occurs even though the device status is still on.
*   **Major bugs:** A specific feature of the application is unable to perform its functionality.
*   **Minor bugs:** GUI bug is commonly the main case falling into a minor bug list.

Additionally, some other kinds of bugs are also found during the mobile application testing process, for example:

*   Slow performance of an application
*   Consumption more from the battery by an application
*   Completely unresponsive behavior of an app

### **18) Explain how A/B testing is done for the iOS app?**

The A/B testing for iOS can be done through three steps:

*   **Step 1:** Configuring a test that prepares two versions of your iOS application (A&B) with required test metrics
*   **Step 2:** Testing both of the iOS versions above on devices simultaneously
*   **Step 3:** Analyzing the test results to measure and select which will be the better version to release

### **19) When should a QA team choose manual testing or automation testing for their mobile test projects?**

Automation testing has vastly increased testers’ speed and quality in the past decades. Understanding when to make such a transition, from manual testing to automated testing, is the first step to maximizing your team’s efficiency. Here are some of the critical points:

**Manual Testing**

*   The capability to make calls and send messages to other devices
*   The compatibility with multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc.)

**Mobile Testing Frameworks and Tools**
---------------------------------------

### **22) What is an Android testing framework?**

One of the most standard testing frameworks for Android applications is the Android testing framework. It is comprised of three segments:

*   **Application Package**          
    It is the target application that requires to be tested.
*   **Instrumentation Test Runner**          
    This part of the framework serves as a Test Case Runner, allowing test cases to run on the target application. It includes two parts: an SDK tool for building test; and a tool that provides APIs for writing program which controls an Android device or an emulator outside of Android codes (i.e., MonkeyRunner)
*   **Test Package**          
    It consists of two components: **Test case classes** and **Mock objects**. Test case classes constitute test methods to perform the on-target application, while mock objects include mock data used as sample input for test cases.

### **23) What is a Robolectric testing framework?**

Testing applying the Android Testing framework with a device or an emulator is challenging. It takes the team’s tremendous development effort and time in building and running tests. And the Robolectric testing framework is considered as a solution to address this challenge.

Robolectric framework allows testers to run Android tests directly on JVM (Java Virtual Machine) without a device or an emulator’s need.
