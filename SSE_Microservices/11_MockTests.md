For observability, I integrated **Prometheus** and **Grafana**, providing real-time insights into resource utilization and latency. This setup allowed the system to handle a **60% increase in traffic** during a promotional event without any downtime.

---

#### **3. Have you worked on event-driven or message-driven architectures?**

**Sample Answer:**  
At **General Electric**, I implemented **Kafka** in the **Production Loss Analysis (PLA)** module for processing high-frequency IoT data from sensors. Kafka ensured durability and scalability for the system, where each topic represented data streams from different industrial assets. The microservices consumed data asynchronously, enabling real-time analysis and insights for operators. This architecture improved the system's throughput by **30%** and provided a robust mechanism for handling spikes in data volume during critical operations.

---

#### **4. How do you ensure fault tolerance in distributed systems?**

**Sample Answer:**  
In the **Property Data Management System**, I ensured fault tolerance by implementing **replication** and **load balancing**. For instance, the backend database used MongoDB with a **replica set** to maintain high availability. Microservices were deployed in a Kubernetes cluster with **multiple replicas** to handle failovers seamlessly. Circuit breakers, configured with tools like **Polly** in .NET Core, prevented cascading failures during network issues. This design reduced downtime by **25%** during system updates or unexpected traffic surges.

---

#### **5. Can you discuss a time when you used NoSQL databases?**
