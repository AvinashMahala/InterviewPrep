        for callback in self.subscribers.get(event, []):
            callback(data)

# Example
pubsub = PubSub()
pubsub.subscribe('event1', lambda data: print(f"Received: {data}"))

Here’s a concise yet comprehensive Python example for a **CoderPad-style interview** that demonstrates **OOP principles**, **SOLID principles**, **design patterns**, and **best software development practices**. The example implements a basic **Order Processing System** using the **Strategy Design Pattern** while adhering to SOLID principles.

---

### **Order Processing System Example**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Open/Closed Principle: Easily extendable without modifying existing code
class PaymentStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def pay(self, amount):
        pass

class CreditCardPayment(PaymentStrategy):
    def __init__(self, card_number):
        self.card_number = card_number

    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Paid ${amount} using Credit Card ending in {self.card_number[-4:]}.")

class PayPalPayment(PaymentStrategy):
    def __init__(self, email):
        self.email = email

    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Paid ${amount} using PayPal account {self.email}.")

# Single Responsibility Principle: Order class handles only order-related tasks
class Order:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
        self.total_cost = 0

    def add_item(self, item_name, price):
        self.items.append((item_name, price))
        self.total_cost += price

    def show_order(self):
        print("Order Summary:")
        for item, price in self.items:
            print(f"- {item}: ${price}")
        print(f"Total: ${self.total_cost}")

# Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level module depends on abstraction
class OrderProcessor:
    def __init__(self, payment_strategy: PaymentStrategy):
        self.payment_strategy = payment_strategy

    def process_order(self, order: Order):
        order.show_order()
        self.payment_strategy.pay(order.total_cost)

# Factory Method Pattern: To dynamically create payment strategies
class PaymentFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_payment_method(method_type, **kwargs):
        if method_type == "credit_card":
            return CreditCardPayment(kwargs["card_number"])
        elif method_type == "paypal":
            return PayPalPayment(kwargs["email"])
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported payment method")

# Best Practices: Encapsulation, Separation of Concerns, and Readable Code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create an order
    order = Order()
    order.add_item("Laptop", 1200)
    order.add_item("Mouse", 50)

    # Choose a payment method
    payment_method = PaymentFactory.create_payment_method(
        method_type="credit_card", card_number="1234567890123456"
    )

    # Process the order
    processor = OrderProcessor(payment_method)
    processor.process_order(order)
```

---

### **Concepts Demonstrated**

1. **OOP Principles**:
   - **Encapsulation**: Classes hide internal implementation details (e.g., `Order` and `PaymentStrategy`).
   - **Abstraction**: `PaymentStrategy` provides a generalized interface for different payment methods.
   - **Polymorphism**: Different payment methods (`CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment`) implement the same `pay` method differently.
   - **Inheritance**: `PaymentStrategy` is the base class for specific payment strategies.

2. **SOLID Principles**:
   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class has one reason to change (e.g., `Order` handles orders, `OrderProcessor` processes them).
   - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Easily add new payment methods without modifying existing code.
   - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Any subclass of `PaymentStrategy` can replace its parent without breaking functionality.
   - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Classes depend only on the methods they use (e.g., `OrderProcessor` depends only on the `PaymentStrategy` interface).
   - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules (`OrderProcessor`) depend on abstractions (`PaymentStrategy`), not concrete implementations.

3. **Design Pattern**:
   - **Strategy Pattern**: Different payment methods are interchangeable at runtime.
   - **Factory Method**: Dynamically creates appropriate payment strategies.

4. **Industry Best Practices**:
   - **Readability**: Clear naming and modular functions.
   - **Scalability**: Easily extensible with new payment methods.
   - **Error Handling**: Raises exceptions for unsupported payment methods.
   - **Separation of Concerns**: Logical separation between order, payment, and processing.

Order Summary:
- Laptop: $1200
- Mouse: $50
Total: $1250
Paid $1250 using Credit Card ending in 3456.
```

Here’s the **Order Processing System Example** implemented in **C#**, showcasing **OOP principles**, **SOLID principles**, **design patterns**, and **best practices** in a concise and clear way:

---

### **Order Processing System in C#**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Open/Closed Principle: PaymentStrategy can be extended for new payment types
public interface IPaymentStrategy
{
    void Pay(decimal amount);
}

public class CreditCardPayment : IPaymentStrategy
{
    private readonly string _cardNumber;

    public CreditCardPayment(string cardNumber)
    {
        _cardNumber = cardNumber;
    }

    public void Pay(decimal amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Paid ${amount} using Credit Card ending in {_cardNumber.Substring(_cardNumber.Length - 4)}.");
    }
}

public class PayPalPayment : IPaymentStrategy
{
    private readonly string _email;

    public PayPalPayment(string email)
    {
        _email = email;
    }

    public void Pay(decimal amount)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Paid ${amount} using PayPal account {_email}.");
    }
}

// Single Responsibility Principle: Order only manages order details
public class Order
{
    public List<(string ItemName, decimal Price)> Items { get; private set; }
    public decimal TotalCost { get; private set; }

    public Order()
    {
        Items = new List<(string, decimal)>();
        TotalCost = 0;
    }

    public void AddItem(string itemName, decimal price)
    {
        Items.Add((itemName, price));
        TotalCost += price;
    }

    public void DisplayOrder()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Order Summary:");
        foreach (var (itemName, price) in Items)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"- {itemName}: ${price}");
        }
        Console.WriteLine($"Total: ${TotalCost}");
    }
}

// Dependency Inversion Principle: OrderProcessor depends on the IPaymentStrategy abstraction
public class OrderProcessor
{
    private readonly IPaymentStrategy _paymentStrategy;

    public OrderProcessor(IPaymentStrategy paymentStrategy)
    {
        _paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }

    public void ProcessOrder(Order order)
    {
        order.DisplayOrder();
        _paymentStrategy.Pay(order.TotalCost);
    }
}

// Factory Method Pattern: Creates payment strategies dynamically
public static class PaymentFactory
{
    public static IPaymentStrategy CreatePaymentMethod(string methodType, Dictionary<string, string> options)
    {
        return methodType.ToLower() switch
        {
            "credit_card" => new CreditCardPayment(options["cardNumber"]),
            "paypal" => new PayPalPayment(options["email"]),
            _ => throw new NotSupportedException("Unsupported payment method")
        };
    }
}

// Best Practices: Encapsulation, Separation of Concerns, and Readable Code
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create an order
        var order = new Order();
        order.AddItem("Laptop", 1200);
        order.AddItem("Mouse", 50);

        // Choose a payment method
        var paymentMethod = PaymentFactory.CreatePaymentMethod(
            "credit_card", 
            new Dictionary<string, string> { { "cardNumber", "1234567890123456" } }
        );

        // Process the order
        var processor = new OrderProcessor(paymentMethod);
        processor.ProcessOrder(order);
    }
}
```

### **Concepts Demonstrated**

1. **OOP Principles**:
   - **Encapsulation**: Each class hides its internal details (e.g., `Order` manages items and totals).
   - **Abstraction**: `IPaymentStrategy` abstracts the payment mechanism.
   - **Polymorphism**: Multiple payment types (`CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment`) implement the same interface.
   - **Inheritance**: Classes implementing the interface adhere to the contract.

2. **SOLID Principles**:
   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: `Order` manages orders, `OrderProcessor` handles processing, and payment classes manage payment logic.
   - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Add new payment types without changing existing classes.
   - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: All implementations of `IPaymentStrategy` can replace the interface without breaking the system.
   - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: `OrderProcessor` depends only on `IPaymentStrategy`, not specific payment implementations.
   - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level `OrderProcessor` depends on the abstraction (`IPaymentStrategy`), not concrete implementations.

3. **Design Pattern**:
   - **Strategy Pattern**: Payment behavior is defined at runtime.
   - **Factory Method**: Creates the correct payment strategy based on input.

4. **Best Practices**:
   - **Readability**: Clean, modular methods and classes.
   - **Error Handling**: Throws an exception for unsupported payment methods.
   - **Scalability**: Easily extendable with new payment strategies.

### **Sample Output**
```plaintext
Order Summary:
- Laptop: $1200
- Mouse: $50
Total: $1250
Paid $1250 using Credit Card ending in 3456.
```

### **How This Example Impresses the Interviewer**
- **Demonstrates Knowledge of Design Principles:** Adheres to SOLID principles and uses a design pattern (Strategy).
- **Modularity and Extensibility:** Easily add new features without modifying existing code.
- **Industry Best Practices:** Includes error handling, clear separation of concerns, and reusable components.
- **Concise Yet Complete:** Covers multiple software engineering concepts in a small example.




Here’s an example of an **Order Management System** using the **Repository Pattern** in **C#**. This demonstrates the **Repository Pattern**, **SOLID principles**, and **industry best practices**. The example is concise and uses a repository abstraction for managing data access.

---

### **Order Management System with Repository Pattern**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Open/Closed Principle: Extendable repositories for different entities
public interface IRepository<T>
{
    T GetById(int id);
    IEnumerable<T> GetAll();
    void Add(T entity);
    void Update(T entity);
    void Delete(int id);
}

// Concrete implementation of Repository for Order
public class OrderRepository : IRepository<Order>
{
    private readonly Dictionary<int, Order> _orderStorage = new();

    public Order GetById(int id) => _orderStorage.ContainsKey(id) ? _orderStorage[id] : null;

    public IEnumerable<Order> GetAll() => _orderStorage.Values;

    public void Add(Order order)
    {
        if (_orderStorage.ContainsKey(order.Id))
        {
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Order with the same ID already exists.");
        }
        _orderStorage[order.Id] = order;
    }

    public void Update(Order order)
    {
        if (!_orderStorage.ContainsKey(order.Id))
        {
            throw new KeyNotFoundException("Order not found.");
        }
        _orderStorage[order.Id] = order;
    }

    public void Delete(int id)
    {
        if (!_orderStorage.ContainsKey(id))
        {
            throw new KeyNotFoundException("Order not found.");
        }
        _orderStorage.Remove(id);
    }
}

// Entity: Order
public class Order
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string CustomerName { get; set; }
    public List<OrderItem> Items { get; set; }
    public decimal TotalCost => ComputeTotalCost();

    public Order()
    {
        Items = new List<OrderItem>();
    }

    private decimal ComputeTotalCost()
    {
        decimal total = 0;
        foreach (var item in Items)
        {
            total += item.Price * item.Quantity;
        }
        return total;
    }
}

// Entity: OrderItem
public class OrderItem
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
}

// Dependency Inversion Principle: Service depends on the abstraction (IRepository)
public class OrderService
{
    private readonly IRepository<Order> _orderRepository;

    public OrderService(IRepository<Order> orderRepository)
    {
        _orderRepository = orderRepository;
    }

    public void CreateOrder(Order order)
    {
        _orderRepository.Add(order);
        Console.WriteLine($"Order {order.Id} for {order.CustomerName} created successfully.");
    }

    public void PrintOrderDetails(int orderId)
    {
        var order = _orderRepository.GetById(orderId);
        if (order == null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Order not found.");
            return;
        }

        Console.WriteLine($"Order ID: {order.Id}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Customer: {order.CustomerName}");
        Console.WriteLine("Items:");
        foreach (var item in order.Items)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"- {item.Name}: ${item.Price} x {item.Quantity}");
        }
        Console.WriteLine($"Total Cost: ${order.TotalCost}");
    }
}

// Best Practices: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Readable Code
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Dependency Injection: Use OrderRepository as the implementation
        var repository = new OrderRepository();
        var orderService = new OrderService(repository);

        // Create an order
        var order = new Order
        {
            Id = 1,
            CustomerName = "John Doe",
            Items = new List<OrderItem>
            {
                new OrderItem { Name = "Laptop", Price = 1200, Quantity = 1 },
                new OrderItem { Name = "Mouse", Price = 50, Quantity = 2 }
            }
        };

        // Add and display the order
        orderService.CreateOrder(order);
        orderService.PrintOrderDetails(order.Id);

### **Concepts Demonstrated**

1. **Repository Pattern**:
   - Encapsulates the data access logic (`OrderRepository`).
   - Decouples the business logic (`OrderService`) from the data storage mechanism.

2. **OOP Principles**:
   - **Encapsulation**: Data storage is hidden inside the repository.
   - **Abstraction**: The `IRepository<T>` interface abstracts the data operations.
   - **Polymorphism**: The `OrderService` depends on `IRepository<T>`, enabling flexible implementations.

3. **SOLID Principles**:
   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class has a single, focused responsibility.
   - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Easily extendable repository implementation for new entities.
   - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: The `OrderService` depends on the abstraction (`IRepository<T>`), not the concrete implementation.

4. **Best Practices**:
   - **Error Handling**: Throws exceptions for invalid operations.
   - **Dependency Injection**: Repository is passed as a dependency to the service.
   - **Readable Code**: Classes and methods are logically structured and named.

### **Sample Output**
```plaintext
Order 1 for John Doe created successfully.
Order ID: 1
Customer: John Doe
Items:
- Laptop: $1200 x 1
- Mouse: $50 x 2
Total Cost: $1300
```

### **Why This Example Stands Out**
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable for new entities (e.g., `CustomerRepository`, `ProductRepository`).
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean separation between data access, business logic, and entities.
- **Demonstrates Industry-Standard Practices**: Repository pattern is widely used in enterprise applications.
