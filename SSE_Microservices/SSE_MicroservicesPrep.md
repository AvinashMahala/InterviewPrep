### **SOLID Principles Overview**

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

---

### **Automotive Example Context**

Imagine an automotive system for handling **vehicle diagnostics and services** (e.g., engine check, oil replacement, and tire pressure monitoring).

---

### **Before Applying SOLID Principles**
A typical poorly designed automotive system violates multiple SOLID principles, resulting in tightly coupled, hard-to-maintain code.

#### **Code Before SOLID**
```csharp
public class CarService {
    public void CheckEngine() {
        Console.WriteLine("Engine check complete.");
    }

    public void ReplaceOil() {
        Console.WriteLine("Oil replaced.");
    }

    public void MonitorTirePressure() {
        Console.WriteLine("Tire pressure monitored.");
    }

    public void GenerateInvoice() {
        Console.WriteLine("Invoice generated.");
    }
}
```

---

### **Problems with the Design**

1. **Violates SRP**:
   - `CarService` handles diagnostics, maintenance, and invoice generation, mixing unrelated responsibilities.

2. **Violates OCP**:
   - Adding a new service (e.g., "Battery Check") requires modifying the `CarService` class.

3. **Violates LSP**:
   - Future subclasses might fail to substitute the `CarService` class without breaking functionality.

4. **Violates ISP**:
   - Clients depending on `CarService` must implement all methods, even if they only need one service.

5. **Violates DIP**:
   - High-level modules (`CarService`) depend directly on low-level implementations (specific diagnostics and maintenance tasks).

---

### **After Applying SOLID Principles**
By applying SOLID principles, the design becomes modular, flexible, and easier to extend and maintain.

---

#### **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

**Problem**:
`CarService` is responsible for multiple unrelated tasks (diagnostics, maintenance, invoicing).

**Solution**:
Separate each responsibility into its own class.

**Refactored Code**:
```csharp
public class EngineCheckService {
    public void CheckEngine() {
        Console.WriteLine("Engine check complete.");
    }
}

public class OilReplacementService {
    public void ReplaceOil() {
        Console.WriteLine("Oil replaced.");
    }
}

public class TirePressureMonitorService {
    public void MonitorTirePressure() {
        Console.WriteLine("Tire pressure monitored.");
    }
}

public class InvoiceService {
    public void GenerateInvoice() {
        Console.WriteLine("Invoice generated.");
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Each class has a single responsibility.
- Changes in one responsibility (e.g., invoicing) don’t affect others (e.g., diagnostics).

---

#### **2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

**Problem**:
Adding new services like "Battery Check" requires modifying the `CarService` class, violating OCP.

**Solution**:
Design the system to allow new services without modifying existing classes by using **interfaces and abstraction**.

**Refactored Code**:
```csharp
public interface ICarService {
    void PerformService();
}

public class EngineCheckService : ICarService {
    public void PerformService() {
        Console.WriteLine("Engine check complete.");
    }
}

public class OilReplacementService : ICarService {
    public void PerformService() {
        Console.WriteLine("Oil replaced.");
    }
}

public class BatteryCheckService : ICarService {
    public void PerformService() {
        Console.WriteLine("Battery check complete.");
    }
}

public class ServiceManager {
    private readonly List<ICarService> _services = new();

    public void AddService(ICarService service) {
        _services.Add(service);
    }

    public void PerformAllServices() {
        foreach (var service in _services) {
            service.PerformService();
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Adding new services (e.g., `BatteryCheckService`) doesn’t require modifying `ServiceManager` or other services.
- System is **open for extension** but **closed for modification**.

---

#### **3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

**Problem**:
Future subclasses of `CarService` might not correctly implement inherited methods, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Solution**:
Ensure subclasses adhere to the parent class behavior, replacing it seamlessly without breaking functionality.

**Refactored Code**:
```csharp
public interface ICarService {
    void PerformService();
}

public class EngineCheckService : ICarService {
    public void PerformService() {
        Console.WriteLine("Engine check complete.");
    }
}

// Substitutable implementation
public class AdvancedEngineCheckService : EngineCheckService {
    public override void PerformService() {
        Console.WriteLine("Advanced engine diagnostics performed.");
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- `AdvancedEngineCheckService` can replace `EngineCheckService` without breaking the `ServiceManager` functionality.
- The system remains **substitutable and robust**.

---

#### **4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

**Problem**:
A single large interface forces clients to depend on methods they don’t use.

**Solution**:
Split interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

**Refactored Code**:
```csharp
public interface IDiagnosticsService {
    void PerformDiagnostics();
}

public interface IMaintenanceService {
    void PerformMaintenance();
}

public class EngineCheckService : IDiagnosticsService {
    public void PerformDiagnostics() {
        Console.WriteLine("Engine diagnostics complete.");
    }
}

public class OilReplacementService : IMaintenanceService {
    public void PerformMaintenance() {
        Console.WriteLine("Oil replaced.");
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Clients depend only on the methods they need.
- Promotes **modularity and simplicity**.

---

#### **5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

**Problem**:
`CarService` directly depends on concrete implementations, making it hard to test or replace components.

**Solution**:
Depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete classes.

**Refactored Code**:
```csharp
public interface ICarService {
    void PerformService();
}

public class ServiceManager {
    private readonly IEnumerable<ICarService> _services;

    public ServiceManager(IEnumerable<ICarService> services) {
        _services = services;
    }

    public void PerformAllServices() {
        foreach (var service in _services) {
            service.PerformService();
        }
    }
}

// Dependency Injection
var services = new List<ICarService> {
    new EngineCheckService(),
    new OilReplacementService()
};

var serviceManager = new ServiceManager(services);
serviceManager.PerformAllServices();
```

**Benefits**:
- High-level modules (`ServiceManager`) depend on abstractions (`ICarService`), not implementations.
- Easier to test and replace individual components.

---

### **Benefits of SOLID Principles**
1. **Maintainability**: Code is easier to understand, debug, and modify.
2. **Extensibility**: New features can be added without breaking existing code.
3. **Testability**: Modular design makes unit testing simpler.
4. **Scalability**: The system can handle growth without becoming unmanageable.

By adhering to SOLID principles, the automotive system becomes robust, extensible, and ready to adapt to future requirements.



Here’s an in-depth explanation of the **design patterns** you mentioned, complete with **use cases, code examples, and key benefits**:

---

## **1. Repository Pattern**
The **Repository Pattern** is used to abstract data access logic, providing a cleaner separation between the business logic and the database.

### **Key Features**
- Centralizes **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Promotes **loose coupling** between the data access logic and business logic.
- Often used with **Unit of Work** for transactional consistency.

### **Code Example**
```csharp
// Define a generic repository interface
public interface IRepository<T> where T : class {
    void Add(T entity);
    void Update(T entity);
    void Delete(T entity);
    IEnumerable<T> GetAll();
    T GetById(int id);
}

// Implement the repository for a specific entity
public class GenericRepository<T> : IRepository<T> where T : class {
    private readonly DbContext _context;

    public GenericRepository(DbContext context) {
        _context = context;
    }

    public void Add(T entity) => _context.Set<T>().Add(entity);
    public void Update(T entity) => _context.Set<T>().Update(entity);
    public void Delete(T entity) => _context.Set<T>().Remove(entity);
    public IEnumerable<T> GetAll() => _context.Set<T>().ToList();
    public T GetById(int id) => _context.Set<T>().Find(id);
}
```

### **Key Benefits**
- Provides a clean abstraction over the database.
- Encourages testability by mocking the repository in unit tests.
- Reduces repetitive data access code.

---

## **2. Unit of Work Pattern**
The **Unit of Work Pattern** groups multiple operations (e.g., repository calls) into a single **transaction**.

### **Key Features**
- Ensures atomicity: all operations succeed or fail together.
- Reduces database connections by batching operations.

### **Code Example**
```csharp
// Define the Unit of Work interface
public interface IUnitOfWork : IDisposable {
    IRepository<Customer> Customers { get; }
    IRepository<Order> Orders { get; }
    void Save();
}

// Implement Unit of Work
public class UnitOfWork : IUnitOfWork {
    private readonly DbContext _context;
    public IRepository<Customer> Customers { get; }
    public IRepository<Order> Orders { get; }

    public UnitOfWork(DbContext context) {
        _context = context;
        Customers = new GenericRepository<Customer>(context);
        Orders = new GenericRepository<Order>(context);
    }

    public void Save() => _context.SaveChanges();
    public void Dispose() => _context.Dispose();
}
```

### **Key Benefits**
- Centralizes transaction management.
- Simplifies multiple repository calls within a single transaction.
- Provides a consistent way to manage database changes.

---

## **3. CQRS Pattern**
**Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** separates **write operations** (commands) from **read operations** (queries).

### **Key Features**
- Improves scalability by optimizing the read and write paths separately.
- Allows **different models** for read and write.

### **Code Example**
```csharp
// Define a Command
public class CreateCustomerCommand {
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
}

// Command Handler
public class CreateCustomerHandler {
    private readonly IRepository<Customer> _repository;

    public CreateCustomerHandler(IRepository<Customer> repository) {
        _repository = repository;
    }

    public void Handle(CreateCustomerCommand command) {
        var customer = new Customer { Name = command.Name, Email = command.Email };
        _repository.Add(customer);
    }
}

// Define a Query
public class GetCustomerByIdQuery {
    public int CustomerId { get; set; }
}

// Query Handler
public class GetCustomerByIdHandler {
    private readonly IRepository<Customer> _repository;

    public GetCustomerByIdHandler(IRepository<Customer> repository) {
        _repository = repository;
    }

    public Customer Handle(GetCustomerByIdQuery query) {
        return _repository.GetById(query.CustomerId);
    }
}
```

### **Key Benefits**
- Clean separation between **commands** and **queries**.
- Optimizes performance: read and write paths can be scaled independently.
- Reduces complexity in data models.

---

## **4. Singleton Pattern**
The **Singleton Pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance and provides global access to that instance.

### **Key Features**
- Useful for shared resources, such as configuration, logging, or caching.
- Implements lazy instantiation for resource optimization.

### **Code Example**
```csharp
// Thread-safe Singleton
public sealed class Logger {
    private static readonly Lazy<Logger> _instance = new(() => new Logger());
    public static Logger Instance => _instance.Value;

    private Logger() { }

    public void Log(string message) {
        Console.WriteLine(message);
    }
}

// Usage
Logger.Instance.Log("This is a log message.");
```

### **Key Benefits**
- Ensures a single, shared instance of the class.
- Reduces memory overhead for shared resources.
- Thread-safe when implemented with proper locking or `Lazy<T>`.

---

## **5. Factory Pattern**
The **Factory Pattern** provides a way to create objects without specifying their concrete class.

### **Key Features**
- Encapsulates object creation logic.
- Promotes loose coupling by delegating instantiation to a factory.

### **Code Example**
```csharp
// Define an interface
public interface ICar {
    void Drive();
}

// Implement concrete classes
public class Sedan : ICar {
    public void Drive() => Console.WriteLine("Driving a Sedan.");
}

public class SUV : ICar {
    public void Drive() => Console.WriteLine("Driving an SUV.");
}

// Factory class
public class CarFactory {
    public ICar CreateCar(string type) => type switch {
        "Sedan" => new Sedan(),
        "SUV" => new SUV(),
        _ => throw new ArgumentException("Invalid car type")
    };
}

// Usage
var factory = new CarFactory();
ICar car = factory.CreateCar("SUV");
car.Drive(); // Output: Driving an SUV.
```

### **Key Benefits**
- Simplifies object creation.
- Promotes loose coupling between client code and the concrete classes.
- Centralizes object creation for better maintainability.

- **Result:** Deployment cycles were reduced from days to hours, ensuring faster delivery of features and bug fixes.

---

### **7. Question: Describe how you optimized container storage and networking using Docker.**
**Answer:**
- **Situation:** While working on a project at Wipro, we noticed performance bottlenecks due to improper container storage and networking configurations.
- **Task:** Optimize Docker containers to reduce latency and improve storage efficiency.
- **Action:** I switched to using Docker volumes for persistent storage and optimized bridge networks to reduce inter-container latency. I also implemented overlay networks to connect containers across multiple hosts.
- **Result:** Storage efficiency improved by 20%, and network latency was reduced by 15%, enhancing application performance.

---

### **8. Question: Have you ever used Cloud Foundry for a multi-cloud deployment?**
**Answer:**
- **Situation:** For a web application project, the client required the application to be deployable on both AWS and Azure without major reconfiguration.
- **Task:** Leverage Cloud Foundry’s cloud-agnostic capabilities for multi-cloud deployment.

CTE, SP vs TVF

### **CTE (Common Table Expression), Stored Procedure (SP), and Table-Valued Function (TVF):**

These three features in SQL are used for different purposes, and each has specific strengths and use cases. Below is a detailed comparison:

---

### **1. Common Table Expression (CTE)**

#### **What It Is:**
- A temporary result set that exists only for the duration of a single query.
- Defined using the `WITH` keyword.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Simplifying complex queries by breaking them into smaller parts.
- Recursion (e.g., hierarchical queries like organizational trees).
- Improving query readability.

#### **Syntax:**
```sql
WITH CTE_Name AS (
    SELECT EmployeeID, ManagerID
    FROM Employees
    WHERE DepartmentID = 1
)
SELECT EmployeeID
FROM CTE_Name
WHERE ManagerID IS NULL;
```

#### **Advantages:**
- Improves readability for complex queries.
- Can be reused within the same query.
- Ideal for hierarchical and recursive queries.

#### **Limitations:**
- Not reusable across different queries.
- Exists only for the duration of the query.

---

### **2. Stored Procedure (SP)**

#### **What It Is:**
- A precompiled collection of SQL statements stored in the database.
- Used to perform a specific task, typically involving multiple queries or operations.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Encapsulating complex logic, such as multi-step business processes.
- Batch processing of data.
- Performing CRUD operations.

#### **Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails
    @DepartmentID INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName
    FROM Employees
    WHERE DepartmentID = @DepartmentID;
END;
```

#### **Advantages:**
- Improves performance by reducing client-server interaction.
- Can accept input/output parameters.
- Can contain complex logic, loops, and conditional statements.
- Reduces the need to send large queries over the network.

#### **Limitations:**
- Cannot be directly used in `SELECT` statements.
- Limited flexibility compared to functions for returning table-like results.

---

### **3. Table-Valued Function (TVF)**

#### **What It Is:**
- A function that returns a table as output.
- Can be **Inline TVF** (simpler) or **Multistatement TVF** (more complex).

#### **Use Cases:**
- Reusable logic to return datasets.
- Simplifying queries by encapsulating reusable logic.
- Returning table-like data for joins and subqueries.

#### **Syntax:**
**Inline TVF:**
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION GetEmployeesByDepartment(@DepartmentID INT)
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN (
    SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName
    FROM Employees
    WHERE DepartmentID = @DepartmentID
);
```

**Multistatement TVF:**
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION GetEmployeesByDepartment(@DepartmentID INT)
RETURNS @EmployeeTable TABLE (
    EmployeeID INT,
    EmployeeName NVARCHAR(100)
)
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO @EmployeeTable
    SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName
    FROM Employees
    WHERE DepartmentID = @DepartmentID;
    
    RETURN;
END;
```

#### **Advantages:**
- Can be used in `SELECT`, `JOIN`, or even `WHERE` clauses like a table.
- Reusable across multiple queries.
- Inline TVFs are optimized for performance.

#### **Limitations:**
- Multistatement TVFs can be slower due to the use of temporary tables.
- Limited to returning a table and cannot perform multiple operations like stored procedures.

### **Choosing the Right Option**

#### **Use CTE When:**
- You need to simplify a complex query for readability.
- Temporary, disposable data sets are required.
- Performing recursive queries.

#### **Use Stored Procedures When:**
- Encapsulating complex business logic.
- Performing multiple database operations (CRUD, loops).
- You need to execute repetitive or batch processes.

#### **Use TVF When:**
- You need to return a reusable table-like dataset.
- Logic needs to be encapsulated and reused in `SELECT` or `JOIN` operations.
- Simplifying query logic by modularizing table-returning logic.

---

### **Examples of Combined Usage**

#### Combining CTE and TVF:
```sql
WITH ActiveEmployees AS (
    SELECT EmployeeID, DepartmentID
    FROM Employees
    WHERE IsActive = 1
)
SELECT *
FROM ActiveEmployees AE
JOIN dbo.GetEmployeesByDepartment(1) TVF
ON AE.EmployeeID = TVF.EmployeeID;
```

#### Combining SP and TVF:
Call a **TVF** within a **Stored Procedure**:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeStats
    @DepartmentID INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(Salary)
    FROM dbo.GetEmployeesByDepartment(@DepartmentID);
END;
```

### **Why Use Functions in SQL?**

Functions in SQL, particularly **scalar functions** (returning a single value) and **table-valued functions (TVFs)** (returning a table), provide modularity, reusability, and maintainability to database logic. Here's a detailed breakdown of why functions are valuable:

---

### **1. Modularity**
- **Purpose:**
  - Encapsulate logic into a single reusable unit.
  - Break down complex queries into manageable components.
  
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION GetTax(@Price DECIMAL(10, 2))
  RETURNS DECIMAL(10, 2)
  AS
  BEGIN
      RETURN @Price * 0.05; -- 5% Tax
  END;

  SELECT ProductName, dbo.GetTax(Price) AS Tax FROM Products;
  ```
  **Why it helps:**
  - Reduces redundant code by centralizing logic.
  - Any update to tax logic can be made in one place.

---

### **2. Reusability**
- **Purpose:**
  - Functions can be called multiple times across different queries, ensuring consistency.

- **Example:**
  Use a **table-valued function** to standardize filtering by department:
  ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION GetEmployeesByDepartment(@DepartmentID INT)
  RETURNS TABLE
  AS
  RETURN (
      SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName
      FROM Employees
      WHERE DepartmentID = @DepartmentID
  );

  SELECT * FROM dbo.GetEmployeesByDepartment(1); -- Reused in multiple queries
  ```

---

### **3. Maintainability**
- **Purpose:**
  - By isolating logic into functions, maintaining and updating code becomes easier.

- **Example:**
  Imagine you calculate discounts in multiple places. Without a function, updating the logic means modifying every query. With a function:
  ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION CalculateDiscount(@Price DECIMAL(10, 2), @DiscountRate DECIMAL(5, 2))
  RETURNS DECIMAL(10, 2)
  AS
  BEGIN
      RETURN @Price - (@Price * @DiscountRate / 100);
  END;

  SELECT ProductName, dbo.CalculateDiscount(Price, 10) AS DiscountedPrice FROM Products;
  ```
  **Why it helps:**
  - Updates (like changing the discount formula) only need to be made in the function.

---

### **4. Readability**
- **Purpose:**
  - Functions simplify queries, especially complex ones, by abstracting details.

- **Example:**
  A **complex calculation** embedded in a query can be abstracted into a function:
  ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION CalculatePerformanceScore(@Sales INT, @Target INT)
  RETURNS DECIMAL(10, 2)
  AS
  BEGIN
      RETURN (CAST(@Sales AS FLOAT) / @Target) * 100;
  END;

  SELECT EmployeeName, dbo.CalculatePerformanceScore(Sales, Target) AS PerformanceScore
  FROM Employees;
  ```
  **Why it helps:**
  - Enhances the clarity of the query logic.

---

### **5. Consistency**
- **Purpose:**
  - Centralized logic ensures that all queries use the same rules and calculations.

- **Example:**
  If multiple queries calculate the same metric (e.g., net profit):
  ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION GetNetProfit(@Revenue DECIMAL(10, 2), @Expenses DECIMAL(10, 2))
  RETURNS DECIMAL(10, 2)
  AS
  BEGIN
      RETURN @Revenue - @Expenses;
  END;

  SELECT Region, dbo.GetNetProfit(Revenue, Expenses) AS NetProfit FROM SalesData;
  ```

---

### **6. Enhancing Query Performance**
- **Purpose:**
  - Inline table-valued functions (TVFs) are optimized by the SQL query optimizer, resulting in efficient execution.

- **Example:**
  Replacing complex joins with a **TVF**:
  ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION GetActiveEmployees()
  RETURNS TABLE
  AS
  RETURN (
      SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName
      FROM Employees
      WHERE IsActive = 1
  );

  SELECT * FROM dbo.GetActiveEmployees();
  ```

---

### **7. Parameterization**
- **Purpose:**
  - Functions allow parameterized logic for dynamic calculations or filtering.

- **Example:**
  Dynamically filter results based on input parameters:
  ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION GetOrdersByDate(@StartDate DATE, @EndDate DATE)
  RETURNS TABLE
  AS
  RETURN (
      SELECT OrderID, OrderDate, CustomerID
      FROM Orders
      WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN @StartDate AND @EndDate
  );

  SELECT * FROM dbo.GetOrdersByDate('2023-01-01', '2023-12-31');
  ```

---

### **8. Security**
- **Purpose:**
  - Functions can encapsulate logic to control what data is accessed and how.
  
- **Example:**
  A function can mask sensitive data:
  ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION MaskSSN(@SSN NVARCHAR(11))
  RETURNS NVARCHAR(11)
  AS
  BEGIN
      RETURN CONCAT('XXX-XX-', RIGHT(@SSN, 4));
  END;

  SELECT EmployeeName, dbo.MaskSSN(SSN) AS MaskedSSN FROM Employees;
  ```

---

### **9. Reduced Network Traffic**
- **Purpose:**
  - Encapsulating logic in functions minimizes the need to send complex queries over the network.

---

### **Limitations of Functions**
1. **No Side Effects:**
   - Functions cannot modify data (unlike Stored Procedures).
   - Only `SELECT` operations are allowed inside functions.

2. **Performance Overhead:**
   - Scalar functions can sometimes degrade performance if overused in large queries.

3. **Limited Error Handling:**
   - Functions cannot use `TRY...CATCH`.

---

### **When to Use Functions**
- When you need **reusable logic** that encapsulates calculations or transformations.
- When queries require **complex filtering** or derived data.
- When consistency in logic across queries is critical.
- When simplifying and abstracting query complexity enhances maintainability.
