Here’s an explanation of **SOLID principles** with an **automotive example**, showing **before and after scenarios**, highlighting the problems, and how each principle solves them.

---

### **SOLID Principles Overview**

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

---

### **Automotive Example Context**

Imagine an automotive system for handling **vehicle diagnostics and services** (e.g., engine check, oil replacement, and tire pressure monitoring).

---

### **Before Applying SOLID Principles**
A typical poorly designed automotive system violates multiple SOLID principles, resulting in tightly coupled, hard-to-maintain code.

#### **Code Before SOLID**
```csharp
public class CarService {
    public void CheckEngine() {
        Console.WriteLine("Engine check complete.");
    }

    public void ReplaceOil() {
        Console.WriteLine("Oil replaced.");
    }

    public void MonitorTirePressure() {
        Console.WriteLine("Tire pressure monitored.");
    }

    public void GenerateInvoice() {
        Console.WriteLine("Invoice generated.");
    }
}
```

---

### **Problems with the Design**

1. **Violates SRP**:
   - `CarService` handles diagnostics, maintenance, and invoice generation, mixing unrelated responsibilities.

2. **Violates OCP**:
   - Adding a new service (e.g., "Battery Check") requires modifying the `CarService` class.

3. **Violates LSP**:
   - Future subclasses might fail to substitute the `CarService` class without breaking functionality.

4. **Violates ISP**:
   - Clients depending on `CarService` must implement all methods, even if they only need one service.

5. **Violates DIP**:
   - High-level modules (`CarService`) depend directly on low-level implementations (specific diagnostics and maintenance tasks).

---

### **After Applying SOLID Principles**
By applying SOLID principles, the design becomes modular, flexible, and easier to extend and maintain.

---

#### **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

**Problem**:
`CarService` is responsible for multiple unrelated tasks (diagnostics, maintenance, invoicing).

**Solution**:
Separate each responsibility into its own class.

**Refactored Code**:
```csharp
public class EngineCheckService {
    public void CheckEngine() {
        Console.WriteLine("Engine check complete.");
    }
}

public class OilReplacementService {
    public void ReplaceOil() {
        Console.WriteLine("Oil replaced.");
    }
}

public class TirePressureMonitorService {
    public void MonitorTirePressure() {
        Console.WriteLine("Tire pressure monitored.");
    }
}

public class InvoiceService {
    public void GenerateInvoice() {
        Console.WriteLine("Invoice generated.");
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Each class has a single responsibility.
- Changes in one responsibility (e.g., invoicing) don’t affect others (e.g., diagnostics).

---

#### **2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

**Problem**:
Adding new services like "Battery Check" requires modifying the `CarService` class, violating OCP.

**Solution**:
Design the system to allow new services without modifying existing classes by using **interfaces and abstraction**.

**Refactored Code**:
```csharp
public interface ICarService {
    void PerformService();
}

public class EngineCheckService : ICarService {
    public void PerformService() {
        Console.WriteLine("Engine check complete.");
    }
}

public class OilReplacementService : ICarService {
    public void PerformService() {
        Console.WriteLine("Oil replaced.");
    }
}

public class BatteryCheckService : ICarService {
    public void PerformService() {
        Console.WriteLine("Battery check complete.");
    }
}

public class ServiceManager {
    private readonly List<ICarService> _services = new();

    public void AddService(ICarService service) {
        _services.Add(service);
    }

    public void PerformAllServices() {
        foreach (var service in _services) {
            service.PerformService();
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Adding new services (e.g., `BatteryCheckService`) doesn’t require modifying `ServiceManager` or other services.
- System is **open for extension** but **closed for modification**.

---

#### **3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

**Problem**:
Future subclasses of `CarService` might not correctly implement inherited methods, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Solution**:
Ensure subclasses adhere to the parent class behavior, replacing it seamlessly without breaking functionality.

**Refactored Code**:
```csharp
public interface ICarService {
    void PerformService();
}

public class EngineCheckService : ICarService {
    public void PerformService() {
        Console.WriteLine("Engine check complete.");
    }
}

// Substitutable implementation
public class AdvancedEngineCheckService : EngineCheckService {
    public override void PerformService() {
        Console.WriteLine("Advanced engine diagnostics performed.");
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- `AdvancedEngineCheckService` can replace `EngineCheckService` without breaking the `ServiceManager` functionality.
- The system remains **substitutable and robust**.

---

#### **4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

**Problem**:
A single large interface forces clients to depend on methods they don’t use.

**Solution**:
Split interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

**Refactored Code**:
```csharp
public interface IDiagnosticsService {
    void PerformDiagnostics();
}

public interface IMaintenanceService {
    void PerformMaintenance();
}

public class EngineCheckService : IDiagnosticsService {
    public void PerformDiagnostics() {
        Console.WriteLine("Engine diagnostics complete.");
    }
}

public class OilReplacementService : IMaintenanceService {
    public void PerformMaintenance() {
        Console.WriteLine("Oil replaced.");
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Clients depend only on the methods they need.
- Promotes **modularity and simplicity**.

---

#### **5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

**Problem**:
`CarService` directly depends on concrete implementations, making it hard to test or replace components.

**Solution**:
Depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete classes.

**Refactored Code**:
```csharp
public interface ICarService {
    void PerformService();
}

public class ServiceManager {
    private readonly IEnumerable<ICarService> _services;

    public ServiceManager(IEnumerable<ICarService> services) {
        _services = services;
    }

    public void PerformAllServices() {
        foreach (var service in _services) {
            service.PerformService();
        }
    }
}

// Dependency Injection
var services = new List<ICarService> {
    new EngineCheckService(),
    new OilReplacementService()
};

var serviceManager = new ServiceManager(services);
serviceManager.PerformAllServices();
```

**Benefits**:
- High-level modules (`ServiceManager`) depend on abstractions (`ICarService`), not implementations.
- Easier to test and replace individual components.

### **Benefits of SOLID Principles**
1. **Maintainability**: Code is easier to understand, debug, and modify.
2. **Extensibility**: New features can be added without breaking existing code.
3. **Testability**: Modular design makes unit testing simpler.
4. **Scalability**: The system can handle growth without becoming unmanageable.

By adhering to SOLID principles, the automotive system becomes robust, extensible, and ready to adapt to future requirements.
