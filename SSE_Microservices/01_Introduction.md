ChargeMate: Developed a Kotlin-based Android application that promotes sustainable vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) battery charger exchange. The application enables car owners to locate and exchange V2V battery chargers, promoting sustainability and is projected to generate nearly $5 million in revenue for both customers and the company.

InfoAnalyzer: Designed and implemented a Django-based simulator for Lucid's infotainment system. The simulator facilitates remote interactions with internal (Android & Linux) devices and allows human-like gestures through a web application interface, ensuring 99.9% system availability. This project enhanced remote control and interaction capabilities for users.

FIAT: Engineered a Robot Framework script generation system for Lucid’s infotainment system, automating navigation and actions. Developed over 100 predefined keywords and paths, decreasing manual effort by 50%, saving nearly 10 software engineering hours. Integrated OCR for text recognition, improving overall automation efficiency by 30% and streamlining testing processes, thus enhancing productivity and accuracy.


PCA: Orchestrated a system using an actuator arm to replicate over 10,000 iterations of human hand gestures for car door operations. Implemented a process to measure performance and identify the infotainment system’s unavailability by leveraging OpenCV for image comparison.
