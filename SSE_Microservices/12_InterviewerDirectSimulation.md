### **1. How have you ensured high availability in a cloud-based system?**

**Expanded Answer:**
"At The Argonaut US, for the retail space planning tool, we needed to ensure high availability due to its critical use by retail partners. I designed a multi-AZ (Availability Zone) deployment using Kubernetes clusters across AWS regions. This setup ensured redundancy at the infrastructure level.

Additionally, I implemented an active-passive database replication strategy using Amazon RDS, enabling failover in case of primary database outages. We also utilized a combination of AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer) and health checks to route traffic to healthy instances dynamically. These measures collectively reduced downtime to less than 0.1%, even during major updates or infrastructure maintenance."

---

### **2. Can you elaborate on a time when you dealt with database optimization under a heavy write workload?**

**Expanded Answer:**
"While working on the Production Loss Analysis module at General Electric, the system needed to process sensor data from hundreds of industrial sites. This resulted in high write workloads in MongoDB.

To handle this:
1. I partitioned the data using sharding, ensuring writes were distributed across multiple nodes.
2. I optimized write performance by batching operations, reducing the overhead on the database.
3. By carefully designing schemas to avoid document bloat, I ensured that frequently written data fit within MongoDB’s page size, reducing disk I/O.

These steps allowed the system to handle a 50% increase in write traffic without performance degradation."

---

### **4. Have you implemented real-time event processing?**

**Expanded Answer:**
"Yes, during the Property Data Management System at The Argonaut US, we needed real-time event processing to synchronize property listings across platforms. I used RabbitMQ as the messaging broker to queue events and implemented consumers to process these events asynchronously.

To ensure reliability, I used message acknowledgment to avoid losing data during processing failures. This design processed over 100,000 events per day with a delay of less than one second, improving data consistency across platforms."

---

### **5. How have you leveraged NoSQL databases in your projects?**

**Expanded Answer:**
"While working on the Property Data Management System, we used MongoDB to store property details due to its flexible schema design. This allowed us to adapt to rapidly changing data requirements without major database migrations.

For performance, I implemented compound indexing on fields frequently used in queries and partitioned large collections based on regions. These optimizations reduced query response times by 40%, even with a growing dataset of millions of properties."

---

### **6. How have you ensured fault tolerance in distributed systems?**

**Expanded Answer:**
"In the Calibration Management module at General Electric, ensuring fault tolerance was critical due to the module’s role in managing industrial equipment. I implemented a combination of retries and circuit breakers using Polly in .NET to handle transient errors.

For database operations, I used transaction logs to ensure consistency in case of partial failures. I also deployed services in Kubernetes, where liveness and readiness probes automatically restarted unhealthy containers. These measures significantly improved system resilience and uptime."

---

### **7. Can you describe your role in designing a microservices-based architecture?**

**Expanded Answer:**
"In the QuizQuest project, I led the design of a microservices architecture to handle quiz content delivery and user tracking. Each service was designed around specific business capabilities, such as content management, user progress tracking, and analytics.

I used Flask for the services and RabbitMQ for inter-service communication. All services were deployed in Docker containers and orchestrated using Kubernetes. This modular design allowed independent deployment and scaling of services, reducing deployment risks and improving system maintainability."

---

### **8. How do you monitor and troubleshoot production systems?**

**Expanded Answer:**
"In the Calibration Management project at General Electric, I set up a robust monitoring stack using ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to aggregate and visualize logs from all microservices. Additionally, I used AWS CloudWatch to monitor resource usage and set alerts for anomalies like high memory or CPU usage.

For troubleshooting, I integrated distributed tracing with Jaeger to trace requests across microservices. This reduced the mean time to resolution (MTTR) for critical production issues by 30%."

---

### **9. How have you integrated third-party APIs effectively?**

**Expanded Answer:**
"During the QuizQuest app development, I integrated a third-party quiz content API. The challenge was managing rate limits and ensuring high availability. To address this, I implemented a caching layer using Redis to store frequently accessed data and used retry logic for transient failures.
