Certainly! Below are the extracted questions from the video, along with answers framed based on your resume:

### Basic Interview Questions

#### 1. **Tell me about your experience and the past projects that you have worked on.**
**Answer**:
I am Avinash Mahala, a Senior Software Engineer with over 5 years of full-stack development experience. My expertise includes .NET Core development, Angular, React, and AWS Cloud Services. At General Electric, I led the development of robust web applications and microservices, leveraging AWS services like Lambda, API Gateway, and EKS. I also implemented CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, and automated testing frameworks, ensuring high code quality. At Wipro, I worked on a vehicle tracking system middleware, significantly reducing downtime and enhancing system stability. My academic background includes a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science Engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington.

### AWS Services Questions

#### 2. **Explain the steps to set up a secure VPC with subnets and everything.**
**Answer**:
1. **Create VPC**: Go to the VPC service in AWS, create a VPC, and set the CIDR block.
2. **Create Subnets**: Create public and private subnets within the VPC.
3. **Configure Route Tables**: Create route tables and associate them with the subnets. Configure routes for public subnets to connect to the internet via an Internet Gateway, and private subnets to connect via a NAT Gateway.
4. **Set up Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway**: Attach an Internet Gateway to the VPC and create a NAT Gateway for the private subnets.
5. **Configure Security Groups and NACLs**: Create security groups and network ACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic.
6. **Enable Monitoring**: Enable VPC flow logs and use CloudWatch for monitoring.

#### 3. **Explain what this IAM policy does.**
**Answer**:
An IAM policy is a JSON document that specifies permissions. For instance, a policy might have:
- **Effect**: Allow
- **Action**: s3:ListBucket
- **Resource**: arn:aws:s3:::company-data
This policy allows listing the objects in the bucket named 'company-data'. Another statement might allow specific actions like running tasks on ECS only if certain conditions are met, such as having a specific ARN.

#### 4. **How do you secure sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and other credentials in a CI/CD pipeline on AWS?**
**Answer**:
To secure sensitive information in a CI/CD pipeline:
1. **AWS Secrets Manager**: Store API keys, passwords, and other secrets in AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store.
2. **IAM Roles**: Use IAM roles to grant CI/CD services access to these secrets.
3. **Rotate Secrets**: Regularly rotate secrets to enhance security.
4. **Encrypt Data**: Use KMS to encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
5. **Monitor and Audit**: Enable CloudTrail to monitor access and changes to secrets.

#### 5. **Name some AWS services which are not region-specific.**
**Answer**:
- IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- Route 53 (DNS service)
- CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)

### Scenario-Based Questions

#### 6. **Describe the key difference between Amazon EC2 and AWS Lambda. When would you choose one over the other for a specific task?**
**Answer**:
- **Amazon EC2**: Provides virtual servers for long-running tasks where you need control over the environment. Suitable for hosting applications, databases, or web servers.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless computing service for short-duration tasks, triggered by events. Suitable for event-driven actions like processing S3 events or API requests without managing servers.

#### 7. **How do you secure sensitive customer data in an AWS RDS database?**
**Answer**:
1. **Encryption**: Use KMS to encrypt data at rest and in transit.
2. **Access Control**: Implement IAM roles and security groups to manage access.
3. **Monitoring**: Enable CloudWatch and AWS Config for continuous monitoring and compliance.
4. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits and comply with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.

#### 8. **Explain the concept of Auto Scaling and how it can be implemented in AWS to handle fluctuating workloads.**
**Answer**:
Auto Scaling adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand. Steps to implement:
1. **Create Auto Scaling Group**: Define the launch configuration and policies for scaling.
2. **Set Scaling Policies**: Define policies based on CPU utilization or other metrics.
3. **Monitoring**: Use CloudWatch to monitor and trigger scaling actions.

### Advanced AWS Questions

#### 9. **Describe how AWS IAM is used to manage permissions and access control in AWS environments.**
**Answer**:
AWS IAM allows managing access to AWS services by creating users, groups, and roles. Policies define permissions:
1. **Users**: Individual users with specific permissions.
2. **Groups**: Collection of users sharing the same permissions.
3. **Roles**: Assigned to AWS services for specific tasks.

#### 10. **Explain the process of setting up a CI/CD pipeline in AWS using CodePipeline and CodeBuild.**
**Answer**:
1. **Source Stage**: Define the source repository (e.g., GitHub, S3).
2. **Build Stage**: Use CodeBuild to compile code, run tests, and produce artifacts.
3. **Deploy Stage**: Deploy artifacts to environments like EC2, ECS, or Lambda.
4. **Integrate with IAM**: Ensure proper IAM roles and policies for secure access.

### Other Questions

#### 11. **How would you improve the performance of a system?**
**Answer**:
- **Optimization**: Profile and optimize code and queries.
- **Scaling**: Implement Auto Scaling for compute resources.
- **Caching**: Use caching mechanisms like ElastiCache.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic using ELB.
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring with CloudWatch to identify bottlenecks.

#### 12. **Design a system to generate unique random strings of given length. The system should be fault-tolerant and horizontally scalable.**
**Answer**:
- **UUID Generation**: Use UUIDs for unique string generation.
- **Distributed System**: Implement a distributed system with consistent hashing for scalability.
- **Database**: Use DynamoDB for storing generated strings.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Implement retries and backups with failover mechanisms.
