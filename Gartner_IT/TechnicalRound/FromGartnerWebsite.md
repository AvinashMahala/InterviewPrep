4. **Join Online Communities**: I joined online forums and communities like Stack Overflow and AWS Developer Forums. This allowed me to ask questions, share knowledge, and learn from others’ experiences.

5. **Apply Knowledge to Project**: Once I felt confident in my understanding, I applied the knowledge to our project at work. I built and deployed serverless functions using AWS Lambda and set up API endpoints with API Gateway.

6. **Continuous Improvement**: After the initial implementation, I continued to learn and optimize our usage of these technologies by staying updated with new features and best practices.

### 3. How do you prioritize your day?

**Answer:**

I prioritize my day by following a structured approach that balances urgent tasks with long-term goals and allows for flexibility to handle unexpected issues.

1. **Morning Planning Session**: At the beginning of each day, I spend 15-20 minutes planning my tasks. I review my calendar, check any meetings or deadlines, and look at my task list.

2. **Prioritize Tasks**: I use the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize tasks into four quadrants: 
   - **Urgent and Important**: Tasks that need immediate attention and have significant impact.
   - **Important but Not Urgent**: Tasks that contribute to long-term goals but don’t need immediate attention.
   - **Urgent but Not Important**: Tasks that require immediate attention but have less impact.
   - **Not Urgent and Not Important**: Tasks that can be minimized or delegated.

3. **Set Daily Goals**: I set 2-3 key goals for the day based on the tasks in the “Urgent and Important” and “Important but Not Urgent” categories. This ensures that I stay focused on high-priority items.

4. **Time Blocking**: I allocate specific blocks of time for focused work on high-priority tasks, ensuring minimal interruptions. I also schedule breaks to recharge and avoid burnout.

5. **Task Management Tools**: I use task management tools like Jira or Trello to keep track of tasks and their priorities. These tools help me visualize my workload and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

6. **Regular Check-Ins**: Throughout the day, I periodically review my progress and adjust priorities if needed. This helps me stay on track and adapt to any changes or urgent issues that arise.

7. **End-of-Day Review**: At the end of the day, I review what I accomplished, update my task list, and plan for the next day. This helps me maintain a sense of achievement and ensures a smooth start to the next day.

By following this structured approach, I can effectively manage my time, stay focused on important tasks, and adapt to any changes or unexpected challenges that come my way.
