### Database Design

1. **Question:** What are the key principles of database normalization?
   - **Answer:** Database normalization involves organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. Key principles include eliminating duplicate data, ensuring data dependencies make sense, and organizing data into logical tables.

2. **Question:** What is a primary key, and why is it important?
   - **Answer:** A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table. It is important because it ensures each record can be uniquely identified and referenced, which is crucial for data integrity and relationships between tables.

3. **Question:** How do you design a one-to-many relationship in a relational database?
   - **Answer:** A one-to-many relationship is designed by creating a foreign key in the child table that references the primary key of the parent table. This foreign key establishes the link between the two tables.

4. **Question:** What is a foreign key, and how does it enforce referential integrity?
   - **Answer:** A foreign key is a field in one table that uniquely identifies a row in another table. It enforces referential integrity by ensuring that the value in the foreign key column corresponds to an existing value in the referenced table's primary key.

5. **Question:** What are indexes, and how do they improve database performance?
   - **Answer:** Indexes are data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. They work like pointers to the data and help in quick lookup, sorting, and filtering operations.

6. **Question:** What is denormalization, and when should it be used?
   - **Answer:** Denormalization involves combining normalized tables to improve read performance at the cost of write performance and data redundancy. It should be used in read-heavy applications where performance is critical.

7. **Question:** How do you handle many-to-many relationships in database design?
   - **Answer:** Many-to-many relationships are handled using a junction table (also called a bridge table or join table) that contains foreign keys referencing the primary keys of the two related tables.

8. **Question:** What is the difference between a clustered and a non-clustered index?
   - **Answer:** A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table and is typically the primary key. A non-clustered index creates a logical order that does not affect the physical order, with pointers to the data.

9. **Question:** What are database constraints, and what types are commonly used?
   - **Answer:** Database constraints are rules enforced on data columns to ensure data integrity. Common types include primary key, foreign key, unique, not null, and check constraints.

10. **Question:** How do you design for scalability in a database?

25. **Question:** What is HATEOAS, and how is it applied in RESTful APIs?
    - **Answer:** HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a constraint of REST APIs that provides links to related resources within the responses. It allows clients to navigate the API dynamically using hyperlinks.

26. **Question:** How do you handle versioning in REST APIs?
    - **Answer:** Versioning in REST APIs can be handled using URL paths (e.g., `/v1/resource`), query parameters (e.g., `/resource?version=1`), or headers (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json`).

27. **Question:** What is the difference between PUT and PATCH methods in REST?
    - **Answer:** The PUT method replaces the entire resource with the provided data, while the PATCH method updates only the specified fields of the resource.

28. **Question:** How do you implement pagination in a RESTful API?
    - **Answer:** Pagination is implemented by returning a subset of results in each response and including metadata like total count, page size, and links to the next and previous pages. Common methods include query parameters (`?page=2&size=10`).

29. **Question:** How do you handle error responses in REST APIs?
    - **Answer:** Error responses are handled by returning appropriate HTTP status codes and including a meaningful error message in the response body. The error response may also include details like error codes and documentation links.
