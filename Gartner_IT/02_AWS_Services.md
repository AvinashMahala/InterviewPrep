72. **Question:** How does Elasticsearch work, and what are its key features?
    - **Answer:** Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine. Key features include full-text search, real-time indexing, distributed architecture, and support for complex queries and aggregations.

73. **Question:** What is the purpose of Logstash in the ELK Stack?
    - **Answer:** Logstash is a data processing pipeline that ingests data from various sources, transforms it, and sends it to destinations like Elasticsearch. It allows you to filter, enrich, and format data before indexing.

74. **Question:** How do you visualize data in Kibana?
    - **Answer:** Data in Kibana is visualized using dashboards, visualizations (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, line graphs), and exploratory tools like Discover and Canvas. It provides interactive and customizable visualizations for analyzing data.

75. **Question:** What are Elasticsearch indices, and how are they managed?
    - **Answer:** Elasticsearch indices are collections of documents that store data in a structured format. Indices are managed using APIs for creating, updating, and deleting indices, as well as configuring settings like mappings and analyzers.

76. **Question:** How do you perform a full-text search in Elasticsearch?
    - **Answer:** Full-text search in Elasticsearch is performed using queries like `match`, `term`, and `bool`. These queries analyze input text and search for matching documents based on specified criteria.

77. **Question:** What is an Elasticsearch cluster, and how is it scaled?
    - **Answer:** An Elasticsearch cluster consists of one or more nodes that store data and perform indexing and search operations. Clusters are scaled by adding or removing nodes and configuring shard and replica settings for data distribution.

78. **Question:** How do you secure an Elasticsearch cluster?
    - **Answer:** An Elasticsearch cluster is secured using features like X-Pack (for authentication, authorization, encryption), configuring role-based access control (RBAC), enabling HTTPS, and setting up IP filtering and firewall rules.

79. **Question:** How do you parse and transform data in Logstash?
    - **Answer:** Data in Logstash is parsed and transformed using filters like `grok`, `mutate`, `date`, and `geoip`. These filters extract fields, modify data, and enrich it before sending it to the destination.

80. **Question:** How do you monitor the health of an ELK Stack deployment?
    - **Answer:** The health of an ELK Stack deployment is monitored using tools like Kibana's Monitoring UI, Elasticsearch APIs for cluster and node stats, and external monitoring solutions like Prometheus and Grafana.

### SAM (Serverless Application Model)

81. **Question:** What is AWS SAM, and what are its benefits?
    - **Answer:** AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. Its benefits include simplified deployment, infrastructure as code, and native support for Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and other AWS services.

82. **Question:** How do you define resources in a SAM template?
    - **Answer:** Resources in a SAM template are defined using YAML syntax. The template includes sections like `Resources`, `Outputs`, and `Globals`, specifying details for Lambda functions, APIs, DynamoDB tables, and other components.

83. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `sam deploy` command?
    - **Answer:** The `sam deploy` command packages and deploys a SAM application to AWS. It uploads the application artifacts to S3 and creates or updates the AWS CloudFormation stack based on the SAM template.

84. **Question:** How do you test a SAM application locally?
    - **Answer:** A SAM application can be tested locally using the `sam local` commands, such as `sam local invoke` for invoking Lambda functions and `sam local start-api` for running APIs locally. This provides a local environment for testing and debugging.

85. **Question:** How do you use environment variables in SAM templates?
    - **Answer:** Environment variables in SAM templates are specified in the `Environment` section of a Lambda function definition. They can be used to configure runtime settings and pass sensitive information securely.

86. **Question:** What is SAM policy templates, and how are they used?
    - **Answer:** SAM policy templates are predefined IAM policy templates that simplify the definition of permissions for serverless applications. They can be referenced in the `Policies` section of a Lambda function definition to grant necessary permissions.

87. **Question:** How do you manage multiple environments in SAM?
    - **Answer:** Multiple environments in SAM can be managed using separate configuration files, parameter overrides, and environment-specific SAM templates. This allows you to deploy applications to different environments like development, staging, and production.

88. **Question:** How do you handle deployment artifacts in SAM?
    - **Answer:** Deployment artifacts in SAM are handled using S3 buckets. The `sam package` command packages the application code and dependencies, uploads them to S3, and generates a packaged template for deployment.

89. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `Globals` section in a SAM template?
    - **Answer:** The `Globals` section in a SAM template defines default properties for all resources of a specific type, such as Lambda functions or APIs. It helps reduce repetition and maintain consistent configurations across resources.

90. **Question:** How do you integrate SAM with CI/CD pipelines?
    - **Answer:** SAM can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and other CI/CD tools. Pipelines can automate the build, test, and deployment processes for serverless applications defined in SAM templates.
