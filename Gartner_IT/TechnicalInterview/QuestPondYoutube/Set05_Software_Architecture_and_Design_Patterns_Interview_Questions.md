### Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening, from whichever location you are watching this video. Welcome to Question Channel! Today, we're going to cover 25 important architecture interview questions, focusing on software architecture. 

**Disclaimer:** Watching this video alone will not make you an architect or help you crack architect interviews. It is crucial to have experience, lead teams technically, solve complex problems, and understand design patterns and architecture patterns. This video is meant as a revision tool.

### Participation Request: 
1. Share in the comments any architecture questions you've been asked in interviews and how you answered them.
2. Let me know which minute you reached in the video to help me analyze viewer engagement.
3. Watch till the end for a special gift.

### Introduction to 25 Questions:

#### Question 1: Explain your project architecture?
When explaining your project architecture, avoid brief answers like "MVC." Elaborate by discussing the different layers (e.g., UI layer, MVC layer, database, cloud), the specific patterns used, and the security measures implemented. Provide detailed and polished answers showing your depth of knowledge.

#### Question 2: Architecture Style vs Architecture Pattern vs Design Pattern
- **Architecture Style:** Defines principles and guidelines at a high level (e.g., REST, SOA).
- **Architecture Pattern:** Provides a structural level view, showing a block diagram without going into code-level details (e.g., MVC, MVVM).
- **Design Pattern:** Offers specific solutions for recurring problems with detailed code-level implementation (e.g., Singleton, Factory).

#### Question 3: What are design patterns?
Design patterns are time-tested solutions for recurring architecture problems. They are categorized into three types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. They provide a common vocabulary and best practices for solving common software design problems.

#### Question 4: Which are the different types of design patterns?
- **Creational Patterns:** Deal with object creation mechanisms (e.g., Singleton, Factory Method).
- **Structural Patterns:** Deal with object composition (e.g., Adapter, Decorator).
- **Behavioral Patterns:** Deal with object interaction and responsibility (e.g., Observer, Strategy).

#### Question 5: Which design pattern have you used in your project?
Examples of commonly used design patterns include:
- **Singleton:** Ensures a class has only one instance.
- **Factory Method:** Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
- **Repository:** Abstracts data access logic, making the code more maintainable.

#### Question 6: Explain Singleton Pattern and the use of the same?
The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It's commonly used for logging, configuration settings, and managing a connection pool.

#### Question 7: How did you implement Singleton Pattern?
The Singleton Pattern can be implemented by:
- Declaring a private static variable to hold the single instance.
- Creating a private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside the class.
- Providing a public static method that returns the instance of the class, initializing it if necessary.

#### Question 8: Can we use Static class rather than using a private constructor?
A static class can be used, but it does not provide the same level of control as the Singleton pattern, particularly for lazy initialization and dependency injection.

#### Question 9: Static vs Singleton Pattern?
- **Static:** A keyword that defines class-level methods and variables. It cannot be instantiated and is not lazy-loaded by default.
- **Singleton:** A design pattern that allows for controlled, lazy initialization and can be used with dependency injection.

#### Question 10: How did you implement thread safety in Singleton?
Thread safety in Singleton can be implemented using locking mechanisms like the `lock` keyword in C#, or by using the `Lazy<T>` class for lazy initialization.

#### Question 11: What is double null check in Singleton?
Double null check is a performance optimization to reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock. It first checks if the instance is null outside the lock, and then again inside the lock to ensure that only one thread initializes the instance.

#### Question 12: Can Singleton pattern code be made easy with Lazy keyword?
Yes, the `Lazy<T>` keyword in C# simplifies the Singleton implementation by handling lazy initialization and thread safety internally.

#### Question 13: Can we get rid of this double null check code?
Yes, using the `Lazy<T>` keyword eliminates the need for explicit double null check code, simplifying the implementation.

#### Question 14: What are GUI architecture patterns, can you name some?
GUI architecture patterns include:
- MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- MVP (Model-View-Presenter)
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

#### Question 15: Explain the term Separation of Concerns (SOC)?
Separation of Concerns (SOC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern. This enhances modularity and maintainability.

#### Question 16: Explain MVC Architecture Pattern?
MVC divides an application into three components:
- **Model:** Manages the data and business logic.
- **View:** Displays the data.
- **Controller:** Handles user input and updates the Model and View accordingly.

#### Question 17: Explain MVP Architecture pattern?
MVP is similar to MVC but includes a Presenter:
- **Model:** Manages data and business logic.
- **View:** Displays the data and delegates user interactions to the Presenter.
- **Presenter:** Handles user input, updates the Model, and updates the View.

#### Question 18: What is the importance of interface in MVP?
In MVP, the View interface defines the methods that the Presenter can call, enabling decoupling and testability by allowing different implementations of the View.

#### Question 19: What is passive view?
A passive view in MVP means the View is not aware of the Model directly and relies completely on the Presenter for any updates or actions. It helps in maintaining a clean separation of concerns.

#### Question 20: Explain MVVM architecture pattern?
MVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel:
- **Model:** Manages the data and business logic.
- **View:** Displays the data.
- **ViewModel:** Acts as an intermediary between the View and the Model, providing data binding capabilities.

#### Question 21: What is the difference between MVP and MVVM?
- **MVP:** The View interacts with the Presenter directly.
- **MVVM:** The View interacts with the ViewModel through data bindings, making it more suitable for frameworks supporting binding like WPF and Angular.

#### Question 22: What is a ViewModel?
A ViewModel is a model for the view in MVVM, encapsulating the data and behavior of the view and exposing it through properties and commands that the view binds to.

#### Question 23: When to use what MVP / MVC / MVVM?
- **MVC:** Use when the framework supports controller-based architecture (e.g., ASP.NET MVC).
- **MVP:** Use for legacy applications without binding support (e.g., WinForms).
- **MVVM:** Use for applications with robust binding support (e.g., WPF, Angular).

#### Question 24: MVC vs MVP vs MVVM?
- **MVC:** Controller handles user input first.
- **MVP:** View handles user input and delegates to the Presenter.
- **MVVM:** View binds directly to the ViewModel, which handles user input.

#### Question 25: Layered architecture vs Tiered?
- **Layered Architecture:** Logical separation of concerns within an application (e.g., presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer).
- **Tiered Architecture:** Physical deployment of layers on different servers or systems, often enhancing scalability and manageability.
