**Avinash Mahala:**

Thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself. My name is Avinash Mahala, and I am a passionate and technically skilled Software Development Engineer with over four years of hands-on experience in designing, building, scaling, and maintaining production services. I recently completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science Engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington, where I graduated in May 2024. I also hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science Engineering from Biju Patnaik University of Technology, which I completed in May 2017.

In my professional journey, I have had the privilege of working with leading organizations such as General Electric and Wipro Limited. At General Electric, I worked as a Software Engineer, where I was involved in refactoring data-intensive API services using C# and SQL Query Optimization techniques. This project resulted in a 94% reduction in latency for processing over 100,000 records. I also developed front-end components using React JS and TypeScript, which enhanced user interfaces and improved user engagement.

During my tenure at Wipro Limited, I served as a Project Engineer. I designed and developed software for a vehicle tracking system middleware using C# and ASP .NET Core, achieving a 91% decrease in downtime and enhancing system stability. I also implemented complex solutions across multiple technology domains, collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver scalable and maintainable solutions.

In addition to my professional experience, I have led several notable projects, including QuizQuest, an interactive quiz app, and MicroMarket, a microservices app. These projects allowed me to apply my skills in cloud computing, API development, and microservices architecture, using technologies such as Java, Python, Django, Flask, React JS, and AWS.

My technical expertise spans a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, including C#, Java, Python, JavaScript, ASP.Net Core, Node.JS, React.JS, and Angular JS. I am also proficient in database design and management, with experience in MongoDB, MS SQL, and MySQL. Additionally, I have a strong background in DevOps practices, including CI/CD, Docker, and Kubernetes.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to join VizyPay as an API Software Developer Senior Engineer because of your commitment to innovation and technological excellence in the FinTech space. I am confident that my skills in API development, cloud services, and software architecture will allow me to contribute effectively to your team and help drive the company's goals forward.

Outside of work, I have a keen interest in embedded engineering, trading technologies, and machine learning. I am also passionate about staying updated with the latest trends in software development and continuously enhancing my skills through online courses and certifications.

Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and experiences align with the needs of your team at VizyPay.
