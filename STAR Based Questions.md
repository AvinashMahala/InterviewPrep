1) Describe a time when you had to deal with a conflict with a coworker or customer, and how you approached and resolved the conflict.

---

**Situation:**

During my tenure at General Electric, we were working on a crucial project that involved refactoring a data-intensive API service. One of my coworkers, who was responsible for a significant part of the backend development, and I had a disagreement on the approach to optimize the SQL queries. He preferred a method that I believed was less efficient and could potentially increase the latency, which was a critical aspect we aimed to reduce.

**Task:**

Our task was to ensure the API service's performance was optimized to handle over 100,000 records efficiently. It was essential to resolve the conflict promptly to maintain the project's timeline and deliver high-quality results.

**Action:**

To address this conflict, I took the following steps:

1. **Private Discussion:** I initiated a private discussion with my coworker to understand his perspective better and explain my concerns in a non-confrontational manner. I made sure to listen actively to his rationale behind his preferred method.

2. **Collaborative Analysis:** We agreed to collaboratively analyze both approaches by setting up a test environment where we could implement and compare the performance of both methods.

3. **Data-Driven Decision:** We executed several test runs to gather data on the performance impact of each approach. This empirical evidence provided a clear comparison of the efficiency and effectiveness of both methods.

4. **Seek Third-Party Opinion:** To ensure an unbiased decision, we involved our team lead and another senior developer to review the test results and provide their input.

5. **Consensus Building:** Based on the test results and the feedback from the senior members, we reached a consensus that my proposed method was more efficient for our specific requirements.

**Result:**

By approaching the conflict with a collaborative and data-driven mindset, we resolved the disagreement without any escalation. This not only optimized the API service, reducing latency by 94%, but also strengthened our professional relationship. The project was completed on time, and the improved API performance significantly enhanced data ingestion efficiency in our closed-loop systems.

This experience taught me the importance of effective communication, active listening, and a collaborative approach to conflict resolution. It reinforced the value of using data and empirical evidence to make informed decisions.
